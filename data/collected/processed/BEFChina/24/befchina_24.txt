This research is done to quantifiy individual tree growth and mortality within and among different species in the comparative study plots. Local neighbourhood interactions are analysed by the means of competition indices. Questions are: (a) does diversity reduce competition? (b) does competition change with successional stage? The data might provide valuable information to be compared with data from the main experiment. We chose 20 target trees each of the two most abundant evergreen species (Castanopsis eyrei FAGACEAE and Schima superba THEACEAE ) and of the two most abundant decidious species (Quercus serrata and Castanea henryi FAGACEAE). Competitors were defined as all trees with a dbh> 10 cm in middle and old successional forests and >3 cm in early successional forests and within a radius that is 1/2 of the height of the target tree. The positions of the competitors in relation to the respective target tree were evaluated (distance and azimuth). Following parameters were measured of all trees: total height, heigth of bifurcatin point, dbh and the crown width in 8 directions.
