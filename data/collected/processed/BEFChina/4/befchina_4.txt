Understanding how species diversity affects plant performance is a central question in biodiversity–ecosystem functioning (BEF) research. At the community level, functional trait means and trait dissimilarities have been used to explain biodiversity effects, but with mixed success. To disentangle how functional traits explain community growth and underpin biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, we should elucidate how plant traits affect individual growth across species richness levels, because the role of functional traits on growth depends on the ecological context of the individual.
