We performed an extensive vegetation survey of the central plots of each CSP in GNNR in 2008. Herb layer communities can serve as ecosystem functioning variable, which is of importance for all community and ecosystem-based statements. We made a detailled description of the herb layer communities in the central plot of each CSP. Herb layer includes all vascular plant species and individuals below 1m height. The vegetation survey includes the identification of all individuals, species abundance was counted, species were classified according to their life form. The presence of tree and shrub seedlings (i.e. woody recruits) in the herb layer can act as an indicator for regeneration.
