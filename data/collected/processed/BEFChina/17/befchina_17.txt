Sand-filled splash cups were used to study the erosivity of rainfall and throughfall in the humid subtropics of southeast China in spring and summer 2010. Our results showed that the splash cup measurements yielded precise and reproducible results both under open field conditions and under forest vegetation. The splash cups were exposed to forest stands of different age and to selected species in the Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (GNNR). This dataset contains the measurements performed under selected trees.
