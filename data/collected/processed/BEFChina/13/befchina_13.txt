This is the 2008 CSP PLFA data from a subset of 12 CSPs representing the age gradient. Samples were analyzed over the depth profile of each CSP (see detailed methods below) and analyzed for phospholipid fatty acid profiles, which represent both the biomass and broad community structure of the soil microbial community including broad groups of bacteria and fungi. The point of this study was to characterize the microbial community of the CSPs, as well as to determine which factors most influence microbial community dynamics, including forest age and other factors. Soil lipid fractions can be seen as functional components of the soil microbes, such as decomposers, etc. This dataset summarizes the different groups of lipid fractions, fungi, bacteria.
