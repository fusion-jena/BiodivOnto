The great 2008 ice storm destroyed considerable areas in the Gutianshan Nature Reserve. In the Comparative Study Plots (CSPs) we quantified the amount of wood downed by the ice storm (coarse woody debris data). Combining data on living and killed trees, we estimated a general unimodal stem breaking probability using a Ricker function. Here we give the averaged deviations from that unimodal function for each species. Positive deviations indicate increased risk to break compared with the general expectation, and negative values indicate a lower risk to break.
