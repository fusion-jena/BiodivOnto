Trees with extrafloral nectaries (EFN) are common in tropical and subtropical forests and the presence of EFN trees within a tree community may influence tree growth. In this dataset EFN-tree-visiting arthropods were collected on all EFN tree species (Ailanthus altissima, Idesia polycarpa, Melia azedarach, Triadica sebifera, Triadica cochinchinensis, excluding Diospyros japonica ) of the main experiment (Site A and B). The data allow to test for tree diversity effects on EFN visitors. All data were collected with direct visual observation of single leaves. Please see Staab et al., 2016, Journal of Plant Ecology (doi:10.1093/jpe/rtw017) for more details on sampling.
