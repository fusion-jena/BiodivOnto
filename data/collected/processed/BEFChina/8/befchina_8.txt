1) Objectives: -- a) Quantify “undisturbed” state prior to snow break. -- b) Quantify carbon and nitrogen stocks in aboveground CWD as a component of a full carbon and nitrogen budget. -- c) Estimate turnover of CWD carbon depending on species, positioning and mortality i) Indirect carbon balance approach: Calculate deadwood input (I) to the forest floor by combining chronosequence data on woody increment and biomass. Calculate turnover under assumption of equilibrium stocks (M/I) ii) Direct approach: Revisit site after 2 to 3 years and measure position, take a sample to estimate density and volume loss (in-situ observations indicate a progression from a solid log to something substantially decayed within few months). -- d) Compare species-specific sensitivities to snowbreak as a trait i) Calculate the likelihood of being subject to snowbreak given the species, size and potentially the relative position using logistic regression ii) Calculate the likelihood of snag survival; this requires re-sampling iii) Estimate the down-slope transport of deadwood pieces iv) Estimate the time it takes for deadwood to collapse and touch the forest floor ----- File asset Plot_skizze.pdf: plot sketch how the debris objects are selected - File asset sp10 CWD_protocol_Gutianshan_AF_20081215_kn.doc: Inventory protocol, should be included into methods ----- 2) Objective allometries: use some of the downed or alive trees to establish coarse allometries to estimate volume of the remaining intems
