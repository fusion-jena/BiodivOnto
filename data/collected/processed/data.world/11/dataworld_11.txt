DESCRIPTION
Fish Health Unit Authorised Sites
SUMMARY
Fish Health Unit registered finfish sites in Ireland where Fish Health regulations and Fish Health monitoring on finfish are applied. Fish health is protected by European legislation (Council Directive 2006/88/EC) designed to prevent and control the spread of certain diseases in aquatic animals. The legislation classifies aquatic disease as either exotic, in which case they are not present in the European Community or non-exotic in which case they occur in certain countries within the community. The Directive was transposed into Irish Law by the European Communities (Health of Aquaculture Animals and Products) Regulations 2008 (SI No. 261 of 2008), European Communities (Health of Aquaculture Animals and Products (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 398 of 2010) and 2011 (S.I. No. 430 of 2011). The regulations introduce measures that reflect the significant growth and development in the aquaculture industry in Ireland over the past 15 years. Specific regulations are in place relating to Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) to prevent the introduction of ostreid herpesvirus into certain areas of Ireland and the United Kingdom. Fish health legislation in Ireland is implemented by the Marine Institute as the Competent Authority.
