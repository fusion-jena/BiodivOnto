SUMMARY
Original Title: Soil analysis and native plant propagation: a case study on Laysan Island, Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument

This final report documents methods and results for 3 objectives of a project funded by the Region 1 Inventory and Monitoring Initiative in FY 2012. Objectives were: Collect soil samples via stratified random sampling for composition analysis; consult horticultural specialists to determine the best locations to outplant specific native plant species; propagate 3 native Hawaiian plant species (Cyperus pennatiformes, Chenopodium oahuense, Santalum ellipticum) on Laysan Island in abundance and out-plant in the recommended areas during the summer of 2012 to test horticulturist recommendations.
