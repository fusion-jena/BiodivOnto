Greenland - Environment
SUMMARY
Contains data from the World Bank's data portal. There is also a consolidated country dataset on HDX. Natural and man-made environmental resources – fresh water, clean air, forests, grasslands, marine resources, and agro-ecosystems – provide sustenance and a foundation for social and economic development. The need to safeguard these resources crosses all borders. Today, the World Bank is one of the key promoters and financiers of environmental upgrading in the developing world. Data here cover forests, biodiversity, emissions, and pollution. Other indicators relevant to the environment are found under data pages for Agriculture & Rural Development, Energy & Mining, Infrastructure, and Urban Development. Indicators: Access to electricity, Adjusted savings, Agricultural land, Agricultural methane emissions, Agricultural nitrous oxide emissions, Arable land, Bird species, CO2 emissions, CO2 emissions from gaseous fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption, CO2 emissions from solid fuel consumption, Capture fisheries production, Coal rents, Energy related methane emissions, Fish species, Forest area, Forest rents, Land area, Land area where elevation is below 5 meters, Mammal species, Marine protected areas, Methane emissions, Methane emissions in energy sector, Mineral rents, Natural gas rents, Nitrous oxide emissions, Nitrous oxide emissions in energy sector, Oil rents, PM2.5 air pollution, People practicing open defecation, People using at least basic drinking water services, People using at least basic sanitation services, People using safely managed drinking water services, People using safely managed sanitation services, Plant species, Population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters, Renewable electricity output, Renewable energy consumption, Renewable internal freshwater resources, Renewable internal freshwater resources per capita, Rural land area, Rural land area where elevation is below 5 meters, Rural population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters, Surface area, Terrestrial and marine protected areas, Terrestrial protected areas, Total fisheries production, Total natural resources rents, Urban land area, Urban land area where elevation is below 5 meters, Urban population living in areas where elevation is below 5 meters
