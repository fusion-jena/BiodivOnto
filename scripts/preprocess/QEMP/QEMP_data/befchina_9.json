The species represent a subset of the Main Experiment�€™s species pool and had been selected according to their representation at the two sites and finally included 6 evergreen and 5 deciduous species. From the species pool, 10 species were implemented at site A and 7 species at site B, thus 6 species were used on both sites. For each species, 3 monoculture plots were selected at each site and used for subplot implementation according to the project-specific experimental setup. The general design of BEF-China provides two �€˜true�€™ replicates of each species�€™ monocultures at the plot level (i.e. where all 20 * 20 planted individuals belong to the same species). As a third replicate, we used 2-species mixtures including the respective target species and therein, all subplots were established in between four individuals of the target species.\n\nAll site-specific target species were planted in suplots either established in their own monoculture (home: 3 replicates each) or in monocultures of the other species within site (away: 9 species * 3 replicates, i.e. 27 plots site A and 18 for site B, respectively). Three monocultures in total, (1 in site A and 2 in site B) could not be realised. This approach was used to test for distance dependence. \n\nIn order to test for effects of density-dependence, each subplot, was then subdivided in split-plots where tree seedlings were planted in conspecific communities at different density levels of 4, 9 and 25 individuals each. Accordingly, in target plots at site A, each five subplots (hosting each two species) were implemented, whereas at site B, the number of subplots per plot was lower because of the lower number of species tested. Thus, in each 29 and 19 plots (for site A and B, respectively), 5 and 4 subplots (for site A and B, respectively) were randomly allocated with each subplot 1.5 m x 1.0 m in size. Each splitplots occupied an area of 0.5 x 0.5 m in size. Species �— density combinations were randomly allocated within subplot.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/577\nMain Experiment: Seedling addition experiment - growth and biomass data\n\n/datasets/577\n\nASCII\n\n\n1\ncolumn\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/577/download.csv?separate_category_columns=true\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Samplenr), \nSamplenr\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Samplenr: An individual number for each taken sample)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each taken sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Seedlingnr), \nSeedlingnr\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Seedlingnr: An individual number for each seedling)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each seedling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Plot), \nPlot\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Plot: Plot)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nPlot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Subplot), \nSubplot\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Subplot: An individual number for each subplot)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each subplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Splitplot), \nSplitplot\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Splitplot: An individual number for each splitplot)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each splitplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Indnr_Splitplot), \nIndnr_Splitplot\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Indnr_Splitplot: An individual number for each seedling within each splitplot)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nAn individual number for each seedling within each splitplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper (Record), \nRecord\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set (Record: number for the records)\n\n\n\n\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelper\nHelper column to understand other columns in this data set\nnumber for the records\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Site (Site), \nSite\nExperimental site of the Main Experiment.
