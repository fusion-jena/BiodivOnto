In  this  study, we  statistically  tested  whether  the  area-diversity  relationship  predicted  by  the  island biogeography  theory  can  successfully  be  used  to  explain  differences  in  tree  species  diversity among  different  woodland  patch  sizes  in  Nyabamba  resettlement  area  of  south-eastern Zimbabwe.  We  used  IKONOS  imagery  of  2009  to  classify  woodland,  plantation  and  cropland areas, and GIS to calculate the woodland patch sizes. Tree species diversity was calculated from field  data  and  then  quantified  using  Simpson�€™s  (1-D)  index.  One  Way  ANOVA  and  Post  Hoc analysis were used to test whether woodland patches of different sizes (less than 4 ha, between 4-25 ha and greater than 25 ha) had significant differences in mean tree species diversity. Our results show that larger patches had significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher mean species diversity than smaller woodland patches. The results indicate that the island biogeography theory can be used to explain tree species diversity differences in an agriculturally fragmented woodland.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Charity Nyelele\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Charity Nyelele\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              30 stratified random sampling point (from a previous generated map), at each point: 15 m x 15 m plot, three size classes calculated (&lt; 4 ha, 4-25 ha, &gt; 25 ha); observing of all trees within the plots\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Nyelele, C. et al., 2014.
