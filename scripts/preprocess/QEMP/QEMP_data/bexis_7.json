From April to June 2014 ten grass and ten forb species were planted as phytometers into 18 grassland EPs per Exploratory by the BELOW project and soil samples were taken in September 2014.  \n    \n      We investigated the relationships between land-use intensity, enzyme activity, microbial biomass and chemical soil properties. We hypothesized that nutriens provided by rhizodeposition would lead to higher microbial colonization and enzyme activities of the rhizosphere soil, and that the extend would be dependent on the individual plant species.\n      Enzyme measurements (beta-glucosidase, xylosidase, N-Acetyl-betaglucosaminidase, phophatase), measurement of soil water content, microbial carbon and nitrogen, ammonium and nitrate on bulk and rhiszosphere soil samples.\n    \n    \n      Microplate Flourescence Reader FLx800, Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.\nAnalytik Jena Multi N/C2100S\nAutonalyzer 3,Bran+Luebbe\n      with specific calibration solution\n      Four potential soil enzyme activities were determined according to Marx et al. (2001) using fluorescent 4-methylumbelliferone substrates (4-MUF; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and a buffered solution (pH 6.1), as described in detail by Berner et al. (2011): β-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21) for cellulose degradation, β-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) for hemicellulose degradation, chitinase (β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, EC 3.2.1.52) and phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1).\n\nSoil water content (SWC) was determined gravimetrically on approximately 5 g of soil; the soil samples were dried at 105 °C until constant weight was reached, minimum 24 hours.\n\nChloroform-fumigation-extraction method (CFE), according to Vance et al. (1987) and Keil et al. (2011), was used to determine microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic). C and N were extracted from each fumigated and non-fumigated replicate (5 g) with 40 ml 0.5 M K2SO4. The suspension was horizontally shaken (30 Min, 150 rpm) and centrifuged (30 Min, 4400 x g). Fumigated sample replicates were incubated with CHCl3 for 24 hours. C and N concentrations in dissolved (1:4, extract:deion. H2O) extracts were measured with a TOC/TN analyzer (Multi N/C 2100S, Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany). The kEC factor (Joergensen, 1996) and the kEN factor of Brookes et al. (1985) were used to calculate microbial C and N, respectively. Based on the non-fumigated samples extractable organic carbon (EOC) and extractable nitrogen (EN) were determined.\n\nMineral nitrogen in form of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) was determined by DIN ISO 14256-2 (2006) with an AutoAnalyzer 3 (Bran &amp; Luebbe, Norderstedt, Germany).\n\nReferences:\nMarx et al.
