Belowground food webs acquire a major fraction of their energy from detritus (Moore and DeRuiter 1991) and therefore are viewed as decomposer or brown food webs. In forests most species either directly consume dead organic matter, in particular leaf litter, feed on microbial decomposers or prey on primary and secondary decomposer animals thereby forming part of the decomposer food web.\n    \n      Soil animal communities are closely linked to qualitative properties and turnover rates of organic matter (Berg and Bengtsson 2007). However, little is known on variations in the structure of decomposer food webs with forest management and time. Therefore, we monitor the community from 2008 onwards.\n      The samples were taken randomly out of the 5 x 5 m subplots but at least 2 m away from the next mature tree or dead wood. In each of four coniferous forests, young man-aged beech and old managed beech stands, and four in unmanaged beech stands. For soil macrofauna large soil cores were taken (5 cm �˜). The litter layer and upper 5 cm of the soil cores were extracted separately by heat (Macfadyen 1961). The abundance of Oribatida species were determined using Weigmann 2006.\n    \n    \n      Soil cores with a diameter of 5 cm, soil animals were extracted using heat (Macfadyen 1961).\n      -\n      -\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    \n      soil macrofauna\n      soil invertebrates\n      belowground\n      food web\n      Oribatida community\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      yyyy-MM-dd\n      2014-05-16\n      2014-05-28\n    \n    2018-07-12\n    2018-08-17\n  \n  \n    structuredData\n    \n    \n    validated\n    complete\n    \n      \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Project\n          string\n          none\n          internal experiment name\n          0\n        \n        \n          Sampling\n          string\n          none\n          Sampling time\n          0\n        \n        \n          PlotID\n          string\n          none\n          Plot number\n          0\n        \n        \n          Exploratory\n          string\n          none\n          Exploratory\n          0\n        \n        \n          Layer\n          string\n          none\n          Layer (soil or  litter in which te samples were taken)\n          0\n        \n        \n          Replicate\n          string\n          none\n          internal number of replicate\n          0\n        \n        \n          Species_name\n          string\n          none\n          Name or Oribatida species \n          0\n        \n        \n          abundance_sample\n          integerNumber\n          Individuals\n          abundance per sample (5 cm in diameter)\n          0\n        \n        \n          abundance_m2\n          realNumber\n          Individuals\n          abundance per square meter\n          0\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      23426\n      23427\n      23429\n    \n    Scheu, Stefan (2018): The soil Oribatida species from 48 forest plots sampled in spring 2014. v1.1.6.
