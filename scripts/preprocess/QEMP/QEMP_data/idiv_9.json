In experiment A, two subplots of 1 x 1 m were established in autumn 2009. In one subplot, regular weeding was continued during the entire study, whereas in the other subplot, weeding was stopped for approximately two years allowing for plant colonization. Those subplots were given up after this sampling campaign. In the experiment B, new subplots (5 x 3 m) were established in 2009, following the same principle as in experiment A: in one subplot, regular weeding was continued, and in the other subplot, weeding was stopped. In both experiments, soil samples were pooled, homogenized, sieved (2 mm), and approximately 5 g (fresh weight) of each soil sample was used for the measurement of soil microbial biomass and respiration. Microbial respiration (µL O2 h-1 g-1 soil dry mass) was measured as mean of the O2 consumption rates of 14 to 24 hours after the start of the measurements using an O2-microcompensation apparatus. Soil microbial biomass C (µg C g-1 soil dry mass) was measured by substrate-induced respiration (SIR) after the addition of D-Glucose. Gravimetric soil water content (%) was determined as the difference in percentages of fresh vs. dry soil (dried at 70 °C for 24 h). \n            \n            \n               Using a metal corer, five soil samples (diameter 2 cm, 10 cm deep) per subplot were randomly taken in June 2011. Additionally, plant cover (%) of resident and colonizing plant species were estimated after Londo (1976) and used as a proxy for plant productivity.  Like described above, five soil samples per subplot were randomly taken in May 2014, i.e., after five years of plant colonization. Here, plant productivity was measured as aboveground plant biomass (g m-2). \n            \n            \n              O2-microcompensation apparatus\n            \n            \n              \n
