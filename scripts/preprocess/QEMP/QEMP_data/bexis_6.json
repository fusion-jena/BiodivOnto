We therefore followed the approach of Volis et al. (2005) and measured the phenotypic variation within and between seed families from a subset of EPs, which provides the between- and within-family components of variance, to estimate broad-sense heritabilities and the environmental component of variation in these traits. This will allow us to assess the bias in QST estimates.\n      We measured a set of phenotypic traits relevant in the context of land use, such as traits related to plant phenology (time to flowering), growth (plant height and biomass) and leaf morphology, allocation strategy (reproductive allocation) as well as fitness (number of flowers and fruits, reproductive biomass).\n    \n    \n      ruler, fine scale\n      none\n      Seeds were collected in 2011 from mother plants at plots. Seeds were cold stratified over winter in soil in the unheated glass house. Up to six seedlings per mother plant were pricked and potted in single pots. In 2012, plants were planted in soil outside in a common garden at Bad Lauchstädt (UFZ Halle). Plants were watered as needed and harvested in 2013 when first fruit had ripened. At harvest, phenotypic traits were measured. Plant parts were dried over night after harvest in a compartment drier and immediately weighted afterwards.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        Schwäbische Alb\n      \n      \n        H\n        Hainich-Dün\n      \n      \n        S\n        Schorfheide-Chorin\n      \n      \n        QST\n        degree of genetic differentiation among populations displayed by quantitative traits\n      \n    \n    \n      diversity\n      grassland\n      plant\n      quantitative genetics\n      selection\n      evolution\n      fitness\n      common garden\n      adaptive\n      traits\n      biomass\n      phenotypic traits\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      dd.MM.yyyy\n      07.05.2012\n      30.07.2013\n    \n    2014-05-12\n    2018-05-29\n  \n  \n    structuredData\n    \n    \n    processed\n    complete\n    \n      \n        \n        NA\n      \n      \n        \n        \n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          No\n          integerNumber\n          \n          order in common garden\n          0\n        \n        \n          EP_off\n          string\n          \n          official EP ID\n          0\n        \n        \n          EP_sort\n          string\n          \n          EP ID for sorting\n          0\n        \n        \n          PlotID\n          string\n          \n          grid plot ID\n          0\n        \n        \n          PlotAbrev\n          string\n          \n          abbreviated plot ID\n          0\n        \n        \n          Explo\n          string\n          \n          abbreviation of exploratory\n          0\n        \n        \n          Mother\n          integerNumber\n          \n          mother ID\n          0\n        \n        \n          Offspring\n          integerNumber\n          \n          offspring category (for internal use)\n          0\n        \n        \n          IndID\n          string\n          \n          individual ID for each offspring\n          0\n        \n        \n          PrickDat\n          date\n          \n          prick of offspring seedlings\n          0\n        \n        \n          PlantDat_status\n          string\n          \n          plant status at planting\n          0\n        \n        \n          PlantDat\n          date\n          \n          planted in common garden\n          0\n        \n        \n          Flow_status\n          string\n          \n          flowering status\n          0\n        \n        \n          Flow_dat\n          date\n          \n          start of flowering\n          0\n        \n        \n          Flow_days\n          integerNumber\n          julian days\n          start of flowering\n          0\n        \n        \n          Harv_dat\n          date\n          \n          harvest\n          0\n        \n        \n          Harv_days\n          integerNumber\n          julian days\n          harvest\n          0\n        \n        \n          Height_cm\n          realNumber\n          cm\n          height at harvest\n          0\n        \n        \n          No_FlowStems\n          realNumber\n          \n          number of flowering stems at harvest\n          0\n        \n        \n          DryWt_stems_g\n          realNumber\n          g\n          dry weigth of vegetative parts at harvest\n          0\n        \n        \n          DryWt_flowers_g\n          realNumber\n          g\n          dry weigth of reproductive parts at harvest\n          0\n        \n        \n          DryWt_tot_g\n          realNumber\n          g\n          dry weight of total aboveground biomass at harvest\n          0\n        \n        \n          ReprAlloc_DryWt_flowers_perc_tot\n          realNumber\n          %\n          reproductive allocation as proportion of dry weight of reproductive parts to whole aboveground biomass\n          0\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Latta RG (2003) Gene flow, adaptive population divergence and comparative population structure across loci. - New Phytologist 161: 51-58.\n      Volis S, Yakubov B, Shulgina I, Ward D, Mendlinger S (2005) Distinguishing adaptive from nonadaptive genetic differentiation: comparison of QST and FST at two spatial scales. - Heredity 95: 466-475.\n    \n    \n      18006 Phenotypic traits of Cynosurus cristatus - common garden 2013 - fitness\n      19506\n    \n    Kloss, Lena; Walter Durka (2018): GenLand - Phenotypic traits of Cynosurus cristatus - common garden 2013 - heritability. v1.1.8.
