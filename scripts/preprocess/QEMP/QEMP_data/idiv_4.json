Qualitative habitat changes induced by fragmentation, such as edge formation and forest regrowth affected bat community structure; both modi��ed habitats comprised a limited subset of the species assemblage found in the interiors of mature forests.The results presented here provide evidence of impoverished bat assemblages in man-modi��ed habitats linked with deforestation and overall disturbances related with forest fragmentation.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Deborah Faria\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Deborah Faria\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n               six main habitat types (interior/ edges * large/ small -&gt; &gt;1000 ha, &lt; 100 ha and secondary forest and shade cocoa plantations) * 3 replicate sampling blocks; mist netting along 100m-transects  in all sites\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Faria, D., 2006.
