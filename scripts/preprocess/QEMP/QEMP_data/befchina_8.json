Sampling was then reduced to five depth increments (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 cm). Samples were air-dried, sieved &lt; 2mm, grinded using a ball mill.\n\nCation exchange capacity (CEC) and concentrations of Na, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Al and H were measured with an ICP-OES (Perkin Elmer DV 5300 ICP OES). The soil samples were percolated with an unbuffered 1 M NH4Cl solution (effective cation exchange capacity). Base saturation percentage (BS) was calculated as proportion of the CEC accounted for by exchangeable bases Na, K, Mg and Ca.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/542\nMain Experiment: Cation exchange capacity, base saturation and soil fertility attributes of depth increments on Site B (2010-2011)\n\n/datasets/542\n\nASCII\n\n\n1\ncolumn\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/542/download.csv?separate_category_columns=true\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot name Main experiment (letter, number code) (plot_number), \nplot_number\nPlot number according to design spreadsheet.
