The chemical composition of the aboveground plant biomass, used as an indicator for plant nutrition and productivity and may also allow the detection of heavy metals or the accumulation of plant defense structures, integrates spatial and temporal variation on soil resources available to plant species during the growing season.\n    \n      XRF allows a nondestructive, highly precise quantitative analysis by simultaneously detecting up to 30 elements in a wide range of organic and inorganic samples even at very low detection levels. Total element concentrations were determined  with wavelength dispersive X-ray florescence spectroscopy (ZSX Primus II, Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan; equipped with a 4kW X-ray tube with Rhodium target). Calibration was performed using certified reference materials of plants kindly provided by Paolo Berzaghi (University of Padua, Italy).\n\nThree widely distributed and on all EP Plots occurring species - one legume, one grass and one herb, were chosen in order to assess nutrient contents in species with different nutrient acquisition and retention strategies. Sampling of these three target species Dactylis glomerata, Trifolium repens and Taraxacum sect. ruderalia took place from mid-May  to mid-June 2015 on 150 EP Plots. For each species about 5g dry-weight leaf biomass without inflorescences from 5 randomly distributed individuals (if available) was sampled and pooled. Vegetation samples were dried at 80°C for 48h, homogenously pulverized and pressed into a 0.5g pellet using a hydraulic press at a load of approximately 7.5 tons. In-house standards were used to monitor and correct analytical drift if necessary (according to Berger et al, 2017).\n\nReferences:\n\nBerger S, Gebauer G, Blodau C and Knorr K.-H.
