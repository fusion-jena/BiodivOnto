Main Experiment plots have a size of 1 mu, which is about 25x25m^2 in horizontal projection. Pilot Study Plots have a size of 1x1 m^2.  \nResearch plots on the main experiment have a \"p\" in front of their IDs and then a 6 digit code: Plots in the main sites A (29°07'28.2\"N 117°54'27.5\"E) and B (29°05'06.8\"N 117°55'44.4\"E) are named according to their position in the original spreadsheet, in which they were designed.

The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\" indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.\nMorover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32.
