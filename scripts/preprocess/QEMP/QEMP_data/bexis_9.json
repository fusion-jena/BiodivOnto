Recently conservation of microorganisms became an issue, especially for WIF (Seibold et al., 2015). However, our knowledge about WIF is only fragmentary and controversial due to limitations in detection methods of fungal communities and a lack of well-designed field experiments with enough replicates (Hoppe et al., 2016; Kubartová et al., 2012; Seibold et al., 2015). Even the most fundamental questions about diversity and tree species preference of WIF have never been tackled using suitable approaches and experiments (Seibold et al., 2015). This study aimed to address two specific questions: (i) are there differences in the diversity of WIF that colonize deadwood of different tree species?, and (ii) do WIF taxa display tree species preference? \n    \n      We use a high resolution culture-independent molecular technique to assess more than just the species that are cultivable. \n      Culture-independent molecular technique (ITS 454pyrosequencing)\nthe primer pair ITS1F (5�€�-CTTGGTCATTTAGAGGAAGTAA-3�€�, Gardes &amp; Bruns 1993) and ITS4 (5�€�-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3�€�, White et al. 1990) to amplify the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA region. The custom primer was constructed with the barcodes and sequencing primers attached at the ITS4 primer for unidirectional sequencing.\n    \n    \n      454pyrosequencing \n      -\n      Wood samples were collected in September 2012 using a cordless drill (Makita BDF 451) equipped with a wood auger (diameter: 10 mm, length 450 mm), which was dipped into alcohol, flamed and wiped with ethanol between drillings to avoid cross-contamination (Purahong, Hoppe, et al., 2014; Purahong, Kahl, et al., 2014). The drill was operated slowly and oriented towards the centre of the log at an angle of �ˆ�90° in relation to a vertical line perpendicular to the stem axis; in order to avoid overheating the sample, the operation was paused periodically (Purahong, Hoppe, et al., 2014). Wood samples were frozen, transported on ice (ca 0 °C) to the laboratory within 3h and stored at �ˆ’20 °C. Each wood sample was homogenized and ground into a fine powder with the aid of liquid nitrogen using a swing mill (Retsch, Haan, Germany).
