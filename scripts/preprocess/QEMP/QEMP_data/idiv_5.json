A total of 28 species and4178 individuals of ground beetles were collected. Segregation of urban forests from continuous suburban forests has changed the species composition and resulted in the loss of some large-sized forest species and theaddition of some non-forest species. Simpson�€™s index of dominance (l) also increased in the urban forests.The richness of forest species markedly decreased with the reduction in forest area but not with the distance from continuous forests, although the species richness of non-forest species did not change with them. Also,species composition changed only with forest area. These ��ndings indicate that continuous forests do notnecessary serve as a �€œmainland�€� for urban forest species and that every urban habitat, however small in size, acts as a temporary reservoir of species. In comparison with populations of small-sized species, populationsof large-sized forest species appeared to decline more readily during forest fragmentation.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Atsushi Fujita\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Atsushi Fujita\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n               3 contiuous suburban plots and 8 isolated urban plots/ fragments (0.06- 10.2 ha); pit fall trapping (12 per plot)\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Fujita, A. et al., 2008.
