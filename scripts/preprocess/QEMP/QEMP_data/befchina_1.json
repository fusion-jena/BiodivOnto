Since \"e\" is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit \"0\" means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\" indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.\nMorover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32.
