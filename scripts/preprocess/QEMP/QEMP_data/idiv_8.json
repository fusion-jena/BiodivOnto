An experimental study of short-term community responses\n            \n            \n              English\n            \n            \n              Abstract.  We  studied  the  effect  of  habitat  fragmentation  on  the  richness,  diversity, turnover, and abundance  of  breeding  bird communities  in  old,  boreal  mixed-wood  forest by  creating  isolated  and connected  forest  fragments  of  1,  10,  40,  and  100  ha.  Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls  was replicated  three times.  We sampled  the passerine  community  using  point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting,  accumulating 21 340 records representing  59  species.  We detected  no  significant  change  in  species richness  as  a result of  the  harvesting,  except  in  the  1-ha  connected  fragments,  where  the  number of  species increased  two  years  after isolation.  This  increase  was  accounted  for by  transient species, suggesting  that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement  corridors. Diversity (log  series  alpha index)  was dependent on area in the isolated  fragments only  after cutting, having  decreased  in  the  smaller  areas. Turnover rates in  the  isolated  fragments  were  sig- nificantly  higher  than in  similar  connected  or control  areas,  due  to  species  replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated  fragments immediately  after cutting,  but two  years after fragmentation, the responses  in abundance of species  varied with migratory strategy. Num- bers of Neotropical  migrants declined in both connected  and isolated fragments, and resident species  declined  in  isolated  fragments.  Most  species  in  these  groups  require older  forest, many  favoring  interior  areas.  Abundance  of  short-distance  migrants,  most  of  which  are habitat  generalists,  did  not  change.  Overall,  although  there  was  no  decrease  in  species richness  from our recently  fragmented areas, community  structure was altered; maintaining connections  between fragments helped to mitigate these effects.  Nevertheless,  the magnitude of  the fragmentation  effects  we  documented  is  small  compared  with  those  observed  else- where.  Birds  breeding  in  the  boreal  forest,  where  frequent  small-  and large-scale  natural disturbances  have  occurred  historically,  may  be  more  resilient  to  human-induced  habitat changes,  such  as  those  caused  by  forest  harvesting.  However,  these  results  should  be  in- terpreted with  caution.  First, they  are short-term and address only  broad-scale  community responses  based  on  species richness  and relative  abundance.  Second,  the  study  area was embedded in a landscape where large areas of old, mixed forest are still available, potentially dampening  any  local-scale  impacts  of  fragmentation.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Fiona K A Schmiegelow\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Fiona K A Schmiegelow\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              4 fragments of varying sizes (1, 10, 40, 100 ha) and two treatments (connected, isolated -&gt; no 400 ha) with common controls (4000 ha); point count method (50-100 m in r) in  permanent sampling stations at 200-m intervals along transects 200-m apart; sampling density in proportion to area size\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Schmiegelow, F.K.A., Machtans, C.S. &amp; Hannon, S.J., 1997.
