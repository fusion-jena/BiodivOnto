The chemical composition of the aboveground plant biomass- used as an indicator for plant nutrition and productivity- and fibre fractions of grassland biomass- used as measure of the quality and nutritive value of herbage fodder- both integrate spatial and temporal variation on soil resources during the growing season (Klaus et al, 2011).  \n    \n      Generally, the data of many chemical components in plant biomass is rarely available for a high number of spatial and temporal replications. Near Infrared Reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) offers the opportunity for rapid and cheap measurements of many chemical constituents in organic materials with very little sample material needed (Kleinebecker et al, 2011). N, P, Ca, Mg, NDF, ADF and ADL show very high measurement precision in small sample sizes; C and P measurements are of acceptable measurement precision due to low variation in concentration and/or low concentration in the analyzed above-ground grassland biomass (Kleinebecker et al, 2011).\n\nThree widely distributed and on all EP Plots occurring species - one legume, one grass and one herb, were chosen in order to assess nutrient contents in species with different nutrient acquisition and retention strategies. Sampling of these three target species Dactylis glomerata, Trifolium repens and Taraxacum sect. ruderalia took place once in May 2014 (early cut, 22607) and and also in August 2014 (late cut, 22608) on 150 EP Plots, where we additionally sampled a fourth species, Plantago lanceolata. For each species about 15 to 30 g freshweight leaf biomass without inflorescences from 5 randomly distributed individuals (if available) was sampled and pooled. Plant biomass was dried at 80°C for 48h, weighed and pulverized using a cyclone mill. \n\nSamples of 2-3g were analyzed in a NIR spectrometer. The reflectance spectrum of each pulverized biomass sample was recorded between 1250 and 2350 nm at 1nm intervals; with each scan consisting of 24 single measurements averaged to one spectrum. Calibration models that were used to predict N, P and K concentrations were derived from previously established calibration models; accuracy of model prediction was checked by applying an external validation process.
