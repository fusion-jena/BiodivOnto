In  1986-1987  three live-trapping  methods  were  used  to  census  small  mammals  at  52 sites  in fragmented  and unfragmented  rain forest  in  NE  Queensland,  Australia.  Forest  structural, floristic,  edaphic  and  landscape  data from  each  site  were used  to  assess  patterns  of  microhabitat  use  in  common species.  Trapping  censuses  yielded  5,784  captures  of  15 species  of  rodents  or  marsupials.  Species  encountered  in modified  habitats  surrounding  fragments  usually  re- mained  stable  or  increased  in  fragments  (Melomys cervinipes, Rattus leucopus,  R.  fuscipes,  Uromys caudi- maculatus,  Antechinus  flavipes,  Hydromys  chryso- gaster),  whereas  those  that  avoided  these  habitats declined  or  disappeared  (A.  stuartii,  A.  godmani,  Hyp- siprimnodon  moschatus).  Fragments  were  more  heavily disturbed  within  200-500  m  of forest  edges,  and  mam- mals  that  favored  disturbed forest  or  edges  (Melomys, R.  leucopus,  A.  flavipes)  increased  in  many fragments. Assemblages  of  abundant  native  rodents  appeared  more intensively  structured  in fragments  than  in  unfragmented .forest,  with  strong  competitive  interactions  occurring  be- tween  ecologically  similar  species  in fragments.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      William F Laurance\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      William F Laurance\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              15 sites of fragmented (10, 1.4- 590 ha) and continuous forests (5, &gt; 3000 ha), trapping in a total of 52 grids (30 m x 30 m), number of grids size dependent\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Laurance, W.F., 1994.
