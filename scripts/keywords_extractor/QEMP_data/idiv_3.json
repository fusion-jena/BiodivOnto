We compared the current bird community structure and composition amongthree habitat types, i.e., old (&gt;50 years, 7�€“935 ha) and young ( 6 50 years, 29�€“49 ha) naturally regenerating secondary forests and abandoned wooded plantations (27�€“102 ha) dominated by exotic species. Forest patch area had the strongest in�‚uence on the current species richness. The overall bird richness was not greater in most mature forest patches, but 20 species were only found inthe old secondary forests and ��ve of these were found in &lt;50% of these patches. The rapid decrease in the number of forest species in plantations was o�€set by an increase in the number of open habitat species. Comparisons with current bird communities in nearby mainland forest sites (Peninsular Malaysia) suggest that the forest avifauna of Singapore is depauperate. The preservation of larger mature and maturing forests is therefore required for conserving the extant forest avifauna in Singapore.Connecting isolated patches can also be envisioned to facilitate movements of forest birds that have low densities and restricted distribution.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Marjorie  Castelletta\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Marjorie  Castelletta\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              9-12 bird surveys in (every one of) 17 patches divided in three classes (different sizes): old secondary forest (6; 7-935 ha), young secondary forest (4; 29-49 ha) and abandonded plantations (7; 27-102 ha), collections with nist netting\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Castelletta, M., Thiollay, J.M. &amp; Sodhi, N.S., 2005.
