In June 2017, dead shells and living individuals were collected from field samples to determine abundances, diversity and community structure. We aimed to quantify the extent to which snail density, diversity and community composition in forests and grasslands are determined by (1) land-use intensity, (2) abiotic drivers and (3) biotic substrates, and (4) whether these effects are consistent across regions.\n    \n      We investigate direct and indirect effects of land-use intensity on snail abundances, diversity and community structure in forests and grasslands.\n      In June 2017, surface samples were taken from all 50 forest and 50 grassland experimental plots (EPs) in the Swabian Alb and the Hainich, and from 49 forest and 34 grassland plots in the Schorfheide. For each EP, surface samples (20 cm �— 20 cm in grasslands and 15 cm �— 15 cm in forests, about 2 cm deep) were collected using a sharp knife, along with the herbaceous vegetation, mosses, litter and the upper soil layer. Samples were taken at the south-east, south-west and north-west corner of the plot and in the middle of the edges between (five replicates per plot). Snail shells were collected by hand using a stereomicroscope. Slugs were not sampled in our study since our sampling method is inappropriate to give a quantitative and qualitative survey. \nShelled snails were subsequently determined to species level using Welter-Schultes (2012), Wiese (2016) and Glöer (2017); we did not distinguish between dead and living snail individuals.\n\nReferences\nGlöer, P. 2017.
