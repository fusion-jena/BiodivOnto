Bats are natural candidates for studies on forest fragmentation. How-ever, the conclusions of such studies are often contradictory. We present the results of a study on the effects of forest fragmentation on bat communities in Alter do Cha�œo, San-tare´m area, in Central Amazonia, Brazil, an area composed by forests and fragments sur-rounded by savanna-like vegetation. We compared the species composition between habitats, tested the effect of size, shape and density of trees of forested areas on the pres-ence species and their relative frequency of captures, and investigated the savannas as anecological barrier for the dispersion of bats. With an effort of 5678 mistnet-hours, we cap-tured 3740 bats (64 species). Multidimensional Scaling indicated no strong separation between the habitats sampled, however, savanna sites were grouped distinctly of frag-ments and forest sites. Multiple linear regressions indicated no signi��cant correlationbetween the number of bat species recorded and the size, shape or tree density in forest sites and fragments. There was a signi��cant correlation between the number of captures and the variables tested, explained by the shape of the sites, but not by size or tree density. In general, sites with bigger shape indices had fewer captures. Ten of the 20 most captured species showed no signi��cant difference between the three habitats. The bat communitiesin Alter do Cha�œo were not strongly affected by forest fragmentation, and the savannas did not appear to act as an ecological barrier to bats.\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Enrico Bernard\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Mario Liebergesell\n                    \n                    \n                      mario.liebergesell@idiv.de\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      Enrico Bernard\n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              bat capturing in 5 continuous forest sites (&gt; 750 ha), 11 forest fragments (6-360 ha, mean: 84,6 ha) &amp; 11 savanna sites; catching nets (12 x 2.5 m) along 150 m transect trails; 6-10 in fragments, 6-12 nets in savannas, 10-14 nets in forest sites\n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                \n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              restricted - part of a meta-analysis (we do not own the data)\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              \n            \n            \n              Bernard, E. &amp; Fenton, M.B., 2007.
