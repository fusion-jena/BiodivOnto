In environmental variables, two remote sensing techniques, spaceborne radar and airborne laser scanning, were employed to derive forest structure. In biodiversity measure, species composition, species richness, and phylogenetic diversity of 12 functional groups were included. To include a comprehensive gradient of forest structure, the data collected in the course of the Exploratories (150 plots) was supplemented by two further projects located in the Steigerwald (69 Plots) and in the Bavarian Forest (BIOKLIM, 244 Plots).\n    \n      1. Airborne laser scanning (ALS)\nALS is a very tangible sensor technology, and the three-dimensional (3-D) insight it provides has led to a number of advances in animal ecology and biodiversity conservation.\n\n2. Radar\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are a prime candidate to meet the demands for ecologically meaningful information on vegetation structure from space from regional to global scales. A big advantage of SAR is the ability to penetrate clouds, making it a suitable technique also for regions with almost constant cloud coverage, such as the tropics or mountain areas. C-band SAR is sensitive to vegetation structures and is likely to be scattered from elements within the canopy of trees.\nThe launch of the Sentinel-1 mission �€“ a constellation of two C-band SAR satellites �€“ by the European Space Agency in 2014 and 2016 has revolutionised SAR remote sensing through their unprecedented combination of high spatial resolution (5 �€“ 20 m), high revisit frequencies (5 �€“ 10 days), complete geographic coverage and last but not least: an open-access distribution policy. \n\n3. Biodiversity measures\nWe separated functional groups based on taxonomy and derived the assemblage composition per functional group by NMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) using presence-absence data. We counted the number of observed species in each plot and log-transformed it for calculating species richness. Additionally, we calculated the standardized effect size of mean phylogenetic distance, as phylogenetic diversity has become influential for understanding ecosystem functioning associated with the assemblage communities and has been used as a proxy for functional diversity.\n\nPlease see more details in Bae et al. (2019)\n      Analysis of original data. The data set comprises aggregated data of original species data per plot as well as environmental data (based on radar and ALS).\n\nOriginal data lists:\n\n1.

Biodiversity measures based on species data\nMethods, grain and timeframe for species sampling - although standardized within the projects - differs between projects, though in various extent. In order to gain comparable estimates of biodiversity measures, data had to be of cropped to a comparable extent and, in parts, to equally determinable species sets.\nManipulations on the original Species Data compiled in the Exploratories, the Steigerwald and BIOKLIM:\nOnly species identified to species level were counted to gain comparable results across projects. An exception to this were in bats the sonotypes \"Myotis branditii/mystacinus\" and \"Plecotus\", which comprise two species each, but which have not been determined to species level in any project. \nPrior to analysis, differences in species composition were visually checked using NMDS. Plots, which lead to stress values of nearly zero were removed as outliers.\nArthropods\nFor Arthropods, Plot HEW34 has been excluded from the analysis as it has been repeatedly destroyed by boars. Also, in ALB, HAI and SCH species collected in April were excluded, as not all Plots have been covered in this month and only \"Priority 1\"-Samples were used to ensure an equal trap number across projects. The plots T3_4 and T2_34 (BIOKLIM) were excluded from analysis. Coleoptera were subdivided into necrophagous, phytophagous, saproxylic and carabid beetles. \nFor spiders, the plots T4_47, T4_75 and T3_10 (all BIOKLIM) were removed as outliers.\nFor carabid beetles, the plots T1_27, T1_34 and T1_57 (BIOKLIM) were removed as outliers.\nFor fungi, we only included wood-inhabiting fungi. Because the fungal communities showed extreme differences between the projects, which was unlikely to be based on regional differences alone but rather an effect of the determinability of cryptic species, data cropped to a list of species which are equally determinable according to a specialist (CB). For instance, crustean species were not included. \nFor lichens, we only included epiphytic lichens.\nConcerning the calculation of phylogenetic diversity, see details in Methods and Supplmentary methods S2 in Bae et al. (2019) \n\n2. Environmental data (radar and ALS metrics)\nAll the environmental variables (except heterogeneity indices including standardized deviation, dissimilarity, and entropy) were averaged within each 1 ha plot.\nThe heterogeneity indices, i.e., standardized deviation, dissimilarity, and entropy, was calculated with window size of 9 by 9 pixels, i.e. 0.81 ha, to consider variability, contrast, and orderliness of the corresponding metrics within each plot \nFoliage height diversity (LiD_FHD) was calculated by the three classes of canopy, understory and regeneration layers.\n    \n    processed\n
