Lab analyses were carried from 2011 to 2012 (SP12)\nThe Gutianshan National Nature Reserve (NNR) is located in the western part of Zhejiang Province (29º8'18\" ���€š���‚��“ 29º17'29\" N, 118º2'14\" ���€š���‚��“ 118º11'12\" E, Fig. 1).  The Gutianshan NNR has an area of approximately 81 km2. From 27 comparative study plots (CSPs) soil samples were taken in 3 depth increments per CSP\nno organisms\n\n\n\nDepth increments were taken from systematic corings: 1 coring per subplot means 9 corings per CSP. Samples were bulked from the 9 corings to one sample per depth increment (0-5, 5-10, 10-20 cm.), so that 3 samples exist per CSP. samples were air-dried, sieved &lt; 2mm, using approx. 500mg per sample for analysis with hedley fractionation method (a sequential extraction method for organic and inorganic P fractions), photometric measurement of Phosphorus with molybdenum blue method according to Murphy &amp; Riley (1962).\nPhosphorus fractions in soils were analyzed by the sequential extraction method according to Hedley (Hedley et al. 1982a). The whole fractionation process used for this data is described in detail by Tiessen and Moir (2008). The general usefulness of this method to determine P in fractions of distinctly different solubility is widely discussed (Condron and Newman 2011, Cross and Schlesinger 1995, Yang and Post 2011). The individual fractions can be described as readily soluble and exchangeable Pi (Pi Resin), desorbable Pi (pi_nahco3) and readily mineralizable Po (po_nahco3), Fe/Al associated Pi (pi_naoh, pi_naoh_s) and Fe/Al associated Po (po_naoh, po_naoh_s), Ca associated Pi (pi_1mhcl, pi_hcl_conc), Ca associated Po (po_hcl_conc), and residual P (tp_residual). For the purpose of subsequent statistical analyses, the Hedley fractions can be grouped by their solubility in labile (pi_resin, pi_nahco3 and po_nahco3), moderate labile (pi_naoh, pi_naoh_s, po_naoh, po_naoh_s, pi_1mhcl) and stable P pools (pi_hcl_conc, po_hcl_conc, tp_residual) as commonly found in literature. (Cross and Schlesinger 1994, de Schrijver et al. 2011, Stevenson and Cole 1999, Yang and Post 2011). \n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/315\nCSPs: Phosphorus fractions of soils: depth increments of 27 Comparative Study Plots\n\n/datasets/315\n\nASCII\n\n\n1\ncolumn\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://china.befdata.biow.uni-leipzig.de/datasets/315/download.csv?separate_category_columns=true\n\n\n\n\n\nLaboratory number of Laboratory of Soil Science and Geoecology in Tübingen (lab_num), \nlab_num\nLaboratory number laboratory Scholten, Kühn, Tübingen.

They consist of 6 digits: _1st digit_: Site (1:A, 2:B), _digit 2and3_: southwards row: as in spreadsheets the rows are named from the top to the bottom; _digit 4 and 5_: westward column: as in the original spreadsheet, but the letters are converted to numbers (A=01, B=02); _6th digit_: indicator, if the plot has been shifted a quarter mu.

Since \"e\" is the fifth letter of the alphabet, this is Plot E26.   The last digit \"0\" means that this plot was not moved by a quarter of a Mu, as some sites in Site A. The 6th digit can also indicate the subplot within the plot. \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\" indicate the northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest quarter plot respectively.\nMorover, Plots from the main experiment may be labelled in the more ambiguous  form of e.g. A32.
