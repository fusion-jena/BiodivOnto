The Gutianshan NNR has an area of approximately 81 km2 and was initially established as a National Forest Reserve in 1975 and became a National Nature Reserve in 2001. The NNR comprises a large portion of broad-leaved forests of advanced successional stages (Hu &amp; Yu 2008), which have not been managed since the beginning of the 1990ies, as well as young successional stages and conifer plantations, mainly of Cunninghamia lanceolata and Pinus massoniana. --- The vegetation is composed of different types of subtropical evergreen and mixed broad-leaved forests (Yu et al. 2001). Most of the stands are secondary forests, evidenced by maximum tree ages of 180 years, by agricultural terraces in almost all plots and by the presence of charcoal in almost all soil profiles. Around the Gutianshan NRR extensive deforestation has occurred during the Great Leap Forward in the 1950s, as in most parts of Southeast China. However, due to prevailing steep slopes, the Gutianshan area was only marginally usable for agricultural activities, and thus an exceptionally intact forest cover has been preserved. --- The climate at Gutianshan NNR is warm and temperate with a short dry season in November and December and with warm summers (Fig. 2). The climatic conditions are characteristic for the subtropics with an annual average temperature of 15.1°C, January minimum temperatures of -6.8°C, July maximum temperatures of 38.1°C and an accumulated temperature sum (≥ 5°C) of 5221.5 degree days.\n\n117.89978\n118.148346\n29.285201\n29.101777\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2008-01-30\n\n\n\n\n2009-11-29\n\n\n\n\n\nTree species in the Comparative study plots.\n\n\nTree species in the Comparative study plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nbschmid\n\n\nmbaruffol\n\n\n\n\nCSPs: Tree size in the CSPs in 2008 and 2009\nTree size in diameter at breastheight (dbh) and/or basal area, as well as height of trees found in the CSPs.

Small stems are measured only in the central plot, larger stems might be in central plot or somewhere else, they are not marked.\nThis data can be used to identify tree stems with the \"stemID\" column. It can also be used to estimate tree size and therefore biomass using allometric equations.
