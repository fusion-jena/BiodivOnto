[{"text":"The World Bacterial Biogeography and Biodiversity through Databases: A Case Study of NCBI Nucleotide Database and GBIF Database\r\n\r\nDatabases are an essential tool and resource within the field of bioinformatics. The primary aim of\r\nthis study was to generate an overview of global bacterial biodiversity and biogeography using\r\navailable data from the two largest public online databases, NCBI Nucleotide and GBIF. The secondary\r\naim was to highlight the contribution each geographic area has to each database. The basis for data\r\nanalysis of this study was the metadata provided by both databases, mainly, the taxonomy and the\r\ngeographical area origin of isolation of the microorganism (record). These were directly obtained\r\nfrom GBIF through the online interface, while E-utilities and Python were used in combination with a\r\nprogrammatic web service access to obtain data from the NCBI Nucleotide Database. Results indicate\r\nthat the American continent, and more specifically the USA, is the top contributor, while Africa and\r\nAntarctica are less well represented. This highlights the imbalance of exploration within these\r\nareas rather than any reduction in biodiversity. This study describes a novel approach to generating\r\nglobal scale patterns of bacterial biodiversity and biogeography and indicates that the\r\nProteobacteria are the most abundant and widely distributed phylum within both databases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Effect of Urbanization on Ant Abundance and Diversity: A Temporal Examination of Factors Affecting Biodiversity\r\n\r\nNumerous studies have examined the effect of urbanization on species richness and most studies\r\nimplicate urbanization as the major cause of biodiversity loss. However, no study has identified an\r\nexplicit connection between urbanization and biodiversity loss as the impact of urbanization is\r\ntypically inferred indirectly by comparing species diversity along urban-rural gradients at a single\r\ntime point. A different approach is to focus on the temporal rather than the spatial aspect and\r\nperform â€œbefore and afterâ€� studies where species diversity is cataloged over time in the same sites.\r\nThe current study examined changes in ant abundance and diversity associated with the conversion of\r\nnatural habitats into urban habitats. Ant abundance and diversity were tracked in forested sites\r\nthat became urbanized through construction and were examined at 3 time points - before, during, and\r\nafter construction. On average, 4.3Â±1.2 unique species were detected in undisturbed plots prior to\r\nconstruction. Ant diversity decreased to 0.7Â±0.8 species in plots undergoing construction and\r\n1.5Â±1.1 species in plots 1 year after construction was completed. With regard to species richness,\r\nurbanization resulted in the permanent loss of 17 of the 20 species initially present in the study\r\nplots. Recovery was slow and only 3 species were present right after construction was completed and\r\n4 species were present 1 year after construction was completed. The second objective examined ant\r\nfauna recovery in developed residential lots based on time since construction, neighboring habitat\r\nquality, pesticide inputs, and the presence of invasive ants. Ant diversity was positively\r\ncorrelated with factors that promoted ecological recovery and negatively correlated with factors\r\nthat promoted ecological degradation. Taken together, these results address a critical gap in our\r\nknowledge by characterizing the short- and long-term the effects of urbanization on the loss of ant\r\nbiodiversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChlamydia caviae infection alters abundance but not composition of the guinea pig vaginal microbiota\r\n\r\nIn humans, the vaginal microbiota is thought to be the first line of defense again pathogens\r\nincluding Chlamydia trachomatis. The guinea pig has been extensively used as a model to study\r\nchlamydial infection because it shares anatomical and physiological similarities with humans, such\r\nas a squamous vaginal epithelium as well as some of the long-term outcomes caused by chlamydial\r\ninfection. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the guinea pig-C. caviae model of genital infection\r\nas a surrogate for studying the role of the vaginal microbiota in the early steps of C. trachomatis\r\ninfection in humans. We used culture-independent molecular methods to characterize the relative and\r\nabsolute abundance of bacterial phylotypes in the guinea pig vaginal microbiota in animals non-\r\ninfected, mock-infected or infected by C. caviae. We showed that the guinea pig and human vaginal\r\nmicrobiotas are of different bacterial composition and abundance. Chlamydia caviae infection had a\r\nprofound effect on the absolute abundance of bacterial phylotypes but not on the composition of the\r\nguinea pig vaginal microbiota. Our findings compromise the validity of the guinea pig-C. caviae\r\nmodel to study the role of the vaginal microbiota during the early steps of sexually transmitted\r\ninfection. The vaginal microbiota of the guinea pig differs from that of humans and cannot prevent\r\nchlamydial infections efficiently. The vaginal microbiota of the guinea pig differs from that of\r\nhumans and cannot prevent chlamydial infections efficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCauses, consequences, and perspectives in the variations of intestinal density of colonization of multidrug-resistant enterobacteria\r\n\r\nThe intestinal microbiota is a complex environment that hosts 1013 to 1014 bacteria. Among these\r\nbacteria stand multidrug-resistant enterobacteria (MDRE), which intestinal densities can\r\nsubstantially vary, especially according to antibiotic exposure. The intestinal density of MDRE and\r\ntheir relative abundance (i.e., the proportion between the density of MDRE and the density of total\r\nenterobacteria) could play a major role in the infection process or patient-to-patient transmission.\r\nThis review discusses the recent advances in understanding (i) what causes variations in the density\r\nor relative abundance of intestinal colonization, (ii) what are the clinical consequences of these\r\nvariations, and (iii) what are the perspectives for maintaining these markers at low levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effects of weather on fungal abundance and richness among 25 communities in the Intermountain West\r\n\r\nBackground Because moisture and temperature influence the growth of fungi, characterizing weather\r\nconditions favorable for fungi may be used to predict the abundance and richness of fungi in\r\nhabitats with different climate conditions. To estimate habitat favorability to fungi, we examined\r\nthe relationship of fungal abundance and species richness to various weather and environmental\r\nparameters in the Intermountain West. We cultured fungi from air and leaf surfaces, and collected\r\ncontinuous temperature and relative humidity measures over the growing season at 25 sites. Results\r\nFungal richness was positively correlated with fungal abundance (r = 0.75). Measures of moisture\r\navailability, such as relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit, explained more of the variance\r\nin fungal abundance and richness than did temperature. Climate measurements from nearby weather\r\nstations were good predictors of fungal abundance and richness but not as good as weather\r\nmeasurements obtained in the field. Weather variables that took into account the proportion of time\r\nhabitats experienced favorable or unfavorable relative humidity and temperatures were the best\r\npredictors, explaining up to 56% of the variation in fungal abundance and 72% for fungal richness.\r\nConclusion Our results suggest that the abundance and richness of fungi in a habitat is limited by\r\nthe duration of unfavorable weather conditions. Because fungal pathogens likely have similar abiotic\r\nrequirements for growth as other fungi, characterizing weather conditions favorable for fungi also\r\nmay be used to predict the selective pressures imposed by pathogenic fungi on plants in different\r\nhabitats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","entities":{"Thing":[{"indices":[10,19]},{"indices":[187,192]},{"indices":[473,483]},{"indices":[484,488]},{"indices":[611,619]},{"indices":[629,641]},{"indices":[642,646],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[674,687]},{"indices":[948,957]},{"indices":[1090,1099]},{"indices":[1256,1265]},{"indices":[1348,1356]},{"indices":[1447,1450]},{"indices":[1451,1460]},{"indices":[1597,1604]},{"indices":[1597,1613]},{"indices":[1873,1880]},{"indices":[2074,2081],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2127,2132]},{"indices":[2173,2176],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2177,2186]},{"indices":[2236,2252],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2244,2252],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2264,2272],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2274,2277],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2278,2287],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2318,2326],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2318,2332],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2483,2490],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2520,2525],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2550,2553],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2586,2593],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2597,2602],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2641,2648],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2652,2657],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2714,2721],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2714,2730],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2793,2800],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2833,2838],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2869,2876],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2936,2943],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3028,3031],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3124,3131],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3189,3193],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3195,3198],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3263,3273]},{"indices":[3263,3273]},{"indices":[3263,3282],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3337,3347],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3337,3359]},{"indices":[3348,3359]},{"indices":[3518,3521],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3578,3587],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3596,3607]},{"indices":[3634,3645]},{"indices":[3671,3681]},{"indices":[3876,3886]},{"indices":[3891,3904]},{"indices":[3891,3917]},{"indices":[4186,4196],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4345,4354],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4358,4367],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4405,4415],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4419,4426]},{"indices":[4561,4570],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4571,4582],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4587,4596],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4664,4673],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4677,4686],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4713,4724],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4752,4762],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4869,4879],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4951,4961],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5075,5085],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5265,5272],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5276,5288],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5312,5326],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5345,5355],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5369,5380],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5405,5413],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5428,5436],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5463,5477],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5503,5512],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5598,5605],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5634,5643],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5678,5685],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5702,5709],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5720,5734],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5915,5922],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5936,5945],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5960,5972],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6139,6146],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6150,6156]},{"indices":[6157,6166],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6171,6179],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6249,6257],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6262,6273],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6288,6294],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6298,6303],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6320,6327],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6329,6339]},{"indices":[6354,6359],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6387,6396],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6401,6409],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6413,6418],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6423,6431],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6447,6454]},{"indices":[6447,6465]},{"indices":[6479,6486]},{"indices":[6503,6508],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6543,6549],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6550,6559],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6564,6571],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6564,6580],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6572,6580],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6592,6599],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6604,6617]},{"indices":[6669,6674],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6688,6692]},{"indices":[6688,6701]},{"indices":[6729,6740],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6754,6762]},{"indices":[6802,6807],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6818,6824],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6825,6833],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6865,6871],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6872,6881],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6906,6914],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6947,6955]},{"indices":[6966,6974]},{"indices":[7006,7014]},{"indices":[701

biodiversity of a freshwater benthic macroinvertebrate community through non-destructive environmental barcoding of DNA from preservative ethanol\r\n\r\nBackground Characterizing biodiversity in a habitat or in targeted taxonomically or\r\nsocioeconomically important groups remains a challenge. Standard DNA-based biodiversity\r\nidentification tools such as DNA barcoding coupled with high-throughput Next-Generation Sequencing\r\n(NGS) technologies are rapidly changing the landscape of biodiversity analysis by targeting various\r\nhabitats and a wide array of organisms. However, effective use of these technological advances\r\nrequires optimized protocols and benchmarking against traditional tools. Here we investigate the use\r\nof commonly used preservative ethanol as a non-destructive and inexpensive source of DNA for NGS\r\nbiodiversity analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates. We used the preservative ethanol added to field\r\ncollected organisms (live sorted bulk benthic samples) as a source of community DNA for NGS\r\nenvironmental barcoding. We directly compare this approach with a DNA barcode library generated\r\nusing Sanger sequencing of all individuals separated from abenthic sample as well as with NGS\r\nenvironmental barcoding of DNA extracted from mixed/homogenized tissue specimens of the same benthic\r\nsample. We also evaluate a multiplex PCR strategy, as compared to commonly used single amplicon\r\nworkflow, using three newly designed primer sets targeting a wide array of benthic macroinvertebrate\r\ntaxa. Results Our results indicate the effectiveness of ethanol-based DNA in providing sequence\r\ninformation from 87% of taxa identified individually from mixture as compared to 89% in conventional\r\ntissue extracted DNA. Missing taxa in both DNA sources were from species with the lowest abundance\r\n(e.g. 1 individual) in the benthic mixture. Interestingly, we achieved 100% detection for taxa\r\nrepresented with more than 1% individuals in the mixture in both sources of DNA. Our multiplex\r\namplification regime increased the detection as compared to any single primer set indicating the\r\nusefulness of using multiple primer sets in initial amplification of target genes. Conclusions\r\nAlthough NGS approaches have significantly increased the potential of using DNA information in\r\nbiodiversity analysis, robust methods are needed to provide reliable data and alleviate sample-\r\nprocessing bottlenecks. Here we coupled non-destructive DNA access and a multiplex PCR approach in\r\nNGS environmental barcoding for effective data generation from benthic live-sorted samples collected\r\nin bulk and preserved in ethanol. Our study provides a possible solution to sampling and vouchering\r\nchallenges in using benthic samples through next-generation environmental barcoding and facilitates\r\nwider utility of DNA information, especially species-specific DNA barcodes, in ecological and\r\nenvironmental studies and real-world applications such as biomonitoring programs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharacterising and Predicting Benthic Biodiversity for Conservation Planning in Deepwater Environments\r\n\r\nUnderstanding patterns of biodiversity in deep sea systems is increasingly important because human\r\nactivities are extending further into these areas. However, obtaining data is difficult, limiting\r\nthe ability of science to inform management decisions. We have used three different methods of\r\nquantifying biodiversity to describe patterns of biodiversity in an area that includes two marine\r\nreserves in deep water off southern Australia. We used biological data collected during a recent\r\nsurvey, combined with extensive physical data to model, predict and map three different attributes\r\nof biodiversity: distributions of common species, beta diversity and rank abundance distributions\r\n(RAD). The distribution of each of eight common species was unique, although all the species respond\r\nto a depth-correlated physical gradient. Changes in composition (beta diversity) were large, even\r\nbetween sites with very similar environmental conditions. Composition at any one site was highly\r\nuncertain, and the suite of species changed dramatically both across and down slope. In contrast,\r\nthe distributions of the RAD components of biodiversity (community abundance, richness, and\r\nevenness) were relatively smooth across the study area, suggesting that assemblage structure (i.e.\r\nthe distribution of abundances of species) is limited, irrespective of species composition.\r\nSeamounts had similar biodiversity based on metrics of species presence, beta diversity, total\r\nabundance, richness and evenness to the adjacent continental slope in the same depth ranges. These\r\nanalyses suggest that conservation objectives need to clearly identify which aspects of biodiversity\r\nare valued, and employ an appropriate suite of methods to address these aspects, to ensure that\r\nconservation goals are met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImpact of biodiversity-climate futures on primary production and metabolism in a model benthic estuarine system\r\n\r\nBackground Understanding the effects of anthropogenically-driven changes in global temperature,\r\natmospheric carbon dioxide and biodiversity on the functionality of marine ecosystems is crucial for\r\npredicting and managing the associated impacts. Coastal ecosystems are important sources of carbon\r\n(primary production) to shelf waters and play a vital role in global nutrient cycling. These systems\r\nare especially vulnerable to the effects of human activities and will be the first areas impacted by\r\nrising sea levels. Within these coastal ecosystems, microalgal assemblages (microphytobenthos: MPB)\r\nare vital for autochthonous carbon fixation. The level of in situ production by MPB mediates the net\r\ncarbon cycling of transitional ecosystems between net heterotrophic or autotrophic metabolism. In\r\nthis study, we examine the interactive effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (370, 600,\r\nand 1000 ppmv), temperature (6Â°C, 12Â°C, and 18Â°C) and invertebrate biodiversity on MPB biomass in\r\nexperimental systems. We assembled communities of three common grazing invertebrates (Hydrobia\r\nulvae, Corophium volutator and Hediste diversicolor) in monoculture and in all possible multispecies\r\ncombinations. This experimental design specifically addresses interactions between the selected\r\nclimate change variables and any ecological consequences caused by changes in species composition or\r\nrichness. Results The effects of elevated CO2 concentration, temperature and invertebrate diversity\r\nwere not additive, rather they interacted to determine MPB biomass, and overall this effect was\r\nnegative. Diversity effects were underpinned by strong species composition effects, illustrating the\r\nimportance of individual species identity. Conclusions Overall, our findings suggest that in natural\r\nsystems, the complex interactions between changing environmental conditions and any associated\r\nchanges in invertebrate assemblage structure are likely to reduce MPB biomass. Furthermore, these\r\neffects would be sufficient to affect the net metabolic balance of the coastal ecosystem, with\r\nimportant implications for system ecology and sustainable exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunity Biomass and Bottom up Multivariate Nutrient Complementarity Mediate the Effects of Bioturbator Diversity on Pelagic Production\r\n\r\nTests of the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationship have focused little attention on the importance\r\nof interactions between species diversity and other attributes of ecological communities such as community biomass.\r\nMoreover, BEF research has been mainly derived from studies measuring a single ecosystem process that often represents\r\nresource consumption within a given habitat. Focus on single processes has prevented us from exploring the\r\ncharacteristics of ecosystem processes that can be critical in helping us to identify how novel pathways\r\nthroughout BEF mechanisms may operate. Here, we investigated whether and how the effects of biodiversity\r\nmediated by non-trophic interactions among benthic bioturbator species vary according to community biomass and\r\necosystem processes. We hypothesized that (1) bioturbator biomass and species richness interact to affect\r\nthe rates of benthic nutrient regeneration [dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP)]\r\nand consequently bacterioplankton production (BP) and that (2) the complementarity effects of diversity will be stronger\r\non BP than on nutrient regeneration because the former represents a more integrative process that can be mediated\r\nby multivariate nutrient complementarity. We show that the effects of bioturbator diversity on nutrient regeneration\r\nincreased BP via multivariate nutrient complementarity. Consistent with our prediction, the complementarity effects\r\nwere significantly stronger on BP than on DIN and TDP. The effects of the biomass-species richness interaction on\r\ncomplementarity varied among the individual processes, but the aggregated measures of complementarity over all ecosystem\r\nprocesses were significantly higher at the highest community biomass level. Our results suggest that the complementarity\r\neffects of biodiversity can be stronger on more integrative ecosystem processes, which integrate subsidiary â€œsimplerâ€�\r\nprocesses, via multivariate complementarity. In addition, reductions in community biomass may decrease the strength of\r\ninterspecific interactions so that the enhanced effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes can disappear well before\r\nspecies become extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep-Sea Biodiversity in the Mediterranean Sea: The Known, the Unknown, and the Unknowable\r\n\r\nDeep-sea ecosystems represent the largest biome of the global biosphere, but\r\nknowledge of their biodiversity is still scant. The Mediterranean basin has been\r\nproposed as a hot spot of terrestrial and coastal marine biodiversity but has\r\nbeen supposed to be impoverished of deep-sea species richness. We summarized all\r\navailable information on benthic biodiversity (Prokaryotes, Foraminifera,\r\nMeiofauna, Macrofauna, and Megafauna) in different deep-sea ecosystems of the\r\nMediterranean Sea (200 to more than 4,000 m depth), including open slopes, deep\r\nbasins, canyons, cold seeps, seamounts, deep-water corals and deep-hypersaline\r\nanoxic basins and analyzed overall longitudinal and bathymetric patterns. We\r\nshow that in contrast to what was expected from the sharp decrease in organic\r\ncarbon fluxes and reduced faunal abundance, the deep-sea biodiversity of both\r\nthe eastern and the western basins of the Mediterranean Sea is similarly high.\r\nAll of the biodiversity components, except Bacteria and Archaea, displayed a\r\ndecreasing pattern with increasing water depth, but to a different extent for\r\neach component. Unlike patterns observed for faunal abundance, highest negative\r\nvalues of the slopes of the biodiversity patterns were observed for Meiofauna,\r\nfollowed by Macrofauna and Megafauna. Comparison of the biodiversity associated\r\nwith open slopes, deep basins, canyons, and deep-water corals showed that the\r\ndeep basins were the least diverse. Rarefaction curves allowed us to estimate\r\nthe expected number of species for each benthic component in different\r\nbathymetric ranges. A large fraction of exclusive species was associated with\r\neach specific habitat or ecosystem. Thus, each deep-sea ecosystem contributes\r\nsignificantly to overall biodiversity. From theoretical extrapolations we\r\nestimate that the overall deep-sea Mediterranean biodiversity (excluding\r\nprokaryotes) reaches approximately 2805 species of which about 66% is                     still\r\nundiscovered. Among the biotic components investigated (Prokaryotes                     excluded),\r\nmost of the unknown species are within the phylum Nematoda, followed                     by\r\nForaminifera, but an important fraction of macrofaunal and megafaunal species\r\nalso remains unknown.

Biomass and Extinction Resistance Determine the Consequences of Biodiversity Loss for Multiple Coastal Ecosystem Processes\r\n\r\nKey ecosystem processes such as carbon and nutrient cycling could be deteriorating as a result of\r\nbiodiversity loss. However, currently we lack the ability to predict the consequences of realistic\r\nspecies loss on ecosystem processes. The aim of this study was to test whether species contributions\r\nto community biomass can be used as surrogate measures of their contribution to ecosystem processes.\r\nThese were gross community productivity in a salt marsh plant assemblage and an intertidal\r\nmacroalgae assemblage; community clearance of microalgae in sessile suspension feeding invertebrate\r\nassemblage; and nutrient uptake in an intertidal macroalgae assemblage. We conducted a series of\r\nbiodiversity manipulations that represented realistic species extinction sequences in each of the\r\nthree contrasting assemblages. Species were removed in a subtractive fashion so that biomass was\r\nallowed to vary with each species removal, and key ecosystem processes were measured at each stage\r\nof community disassembly. The functional contribution of species was directly proportional to their\r\ncontribution to community biomass in a 1âˆ¶1 ratio, a relationship that was consistent across three\r\ncontrasting marine ecosystems and three ecosystem processes. This suggests that the biomass\r\ncontributed by a species to an assemblage can be used to approximately predict the proportional\r\ndecline in an ecosystem process when that species is lost. Such predictions represent â€œworst case\r\nscenariosâ€� because, over time, extinction resilient species can offset the loss of biomass\r\nassociated with the extinction of competitors. We also modelled a â€œbest case scenarioâ€� that accounts\r\nfor compensatory responses by the extant species with the highest per capita contribution to\r\necosystem processes. These worst and best case scenarios could be used to predict the minimum and\r\nmaximum species required to sustain threshold values of ecosystem processes in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes Presence of a Mid-Ocean Ridge Enhance Biomass and Biodiversity?\r\n\r\nIn contrast to generally sparse biological communities in open-ocean settings, seamounts and ridges\r\nare perceived as areas of elevated productivity and biodiversity capable of supporting commercial\r\nfisheries. We investigated the origin of this apparent biological enhancement over a segment of the\r\nNorth Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) using sonar, corers, trawls, traps, and a remotely operated vehicle\r\nto survey habitat, biomass, and biodiversity. Satellite remote sensing provided information on flow\r\npatterns, thermal fronts, and primary production, while sediment traps measured export flux during\r\n2007â€“2010. The MAR, 3,704,404 km2 in area, accounts for 44.7% lower bathyal habitat (800â€“3500 m\r\ndepth) in the North Atlantic and is dominated by fine soft sediment substrate (95% of area) on a\r\nseries of flat terraces with intervening slopes either side of the ridge axis contributing to\r\nhabitat heterogeneity. The MAR fauna comprises mainly species known from continental margins with no\r\nevidence of greater biodiversity. Primary production and export flux over the MAR were not enhanced\r\ncompared with a nearby reference station over the Porcupine Abyssal Plain. Biomasses of benthic\r\nmacrofauna and megafauna were similar to global averages at the same depths totalling an estimated\r\n258.9 kt C over the entire lower bathyal north MAR. A hypothetical flat plain at 3500 m depth in\r\nplace of the MAR would contain 85.6 kt C, implying an increase of 173.3 kt C attributable to the\r\npresence of the Ridge. This is approximately equal to 167 kt C of estimated pelagic biomass\r\ndisplaced by the volume of the MAR. There is no enhancement of biological productivity over the MAR;\r\noceanic bathypelagic species are replaced by benthic fauna otherwise unable to survive in the mid\r\nocean. We propose that globally sea floor elevation has no effect on deep sea biomass; pelagic plus\r\nbenthic biomass is constant within a given surface productivity regime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Float or Not to Float: How Interactions between Light and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Species Determine the Buoyancy of Stratiotes aloides\r\n\r\nStructural diversity formed by dense, floating Stratiotes aloides stands, generates hotspots of\r\nbiodiversity of flora and fauna in wetlands. However, only part of the populations become emergent\r\nand provide this important facilitation. Since it has been hypothesised that its buoyancy depends on\r\nthe rates of underwater photosynthesis, we investigated the role of dissolved CO2 availability and\r\nPAR on photosynthesis, biomass production and buoyancy in a controlled greenhouse experiment.\r\nPhotosynthesis and growth were strongly influenced by both PAR and CO2 availability. At low PAR,\r\nplants formed less biomass and produced no emergent leaves, even when CO2 was abundant. At low CO2\r\nlevels, S. aloides switched to HCO3- use, resulting in a lower photosynthetic O2 production,\r\ndecreased emergent leaf formation and increased CaCO3 precipitation on its leaves, all of which\r\nimpaired buoyancy. At high PAR, low CO2 availability resulted in slower colonisation of the water\r\nlayer, whereas CO2 availability did not influence PAR-limited plants. Our study shows that site\r\nconditions, rather than the sole abundance of potentially facilitating species, may strongly\r\ndetermine whether or not they form the structure necessary to act as a facilitator for biodiversity\r\nin aquatic environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Insect Herbivore Microbiome with High Plant Biomass-Degrading Capacity\r\n\r\nHerbivores can gain indirect access to recalcitrant carbon present in plant cell walls through\r\nsymbiotic associations with lignocellulolytic microbes. A paradigmatic example is the leaf-cutter\r\nant (Tribe: Attini), which uses fresh leaves to cultivate a fungus for food in specialized gardens.\r\nUsing a combination of sugar composition analyses, metagenomics, and whole-genome sequencing, we\r\nreveal that the fungus garden microbiome of leaf-cutter ants is composed of a diverse community of\r\nbacteria with high plant biomass-degrading capacity. Comparison of this microbiome's predicted\r\ncarbohydrate-degrading enzyme profile with other metagenomes shows closest similarity to the bovine\r\nrumen, indicating evolutionary convergence of plant biomass degrading potential between two\r\nimportant herbivorous animals. Genomic and physiological characterization of two dominant bacteria\r\nin the fungus garden microbiome provides evidence of their capacity to degrade cellulose. Given the\r\nrecent interest in cellulosic biofuels, understanding how large-scale and rapid plant biomass\r\ndegradation occurs in a highly evolved insect herbivore is of particular relevance for bioenergy.\nAuthor Summary Leaf-cutter ants form massive subterranean colonies containing millions of workers\r\nthat harvest hundreds of kilograms of leaves each year. They use these leaves to grow a mutualistic\r\nfungus that serves as the colony's primary food source. By farming fungus in specialized garden\r\nchambers, these dominant Neotropical herbivores facilitate rapid large-scale plant biomass\r\nconversion. Our understanding of this degradation process, and the responsible microbial community,\r\nis limited. In this study, we track the degradation of plant polymers in leaf-cutter ant fungus\r\ngardens and characterize the microbial community potentially mediating this process. We show that\r\ncellulose and hemicelluloses are degraded in the fungus gardens and that a previously unknown\r\nmicrobial community containing a diversity of bacteria is present. Metagenomic analysis of this\r\ncommunity's genetic content revealed many genes predicted to encode enzymes capable of degrading\r\nplant cell walls. The ability of leaf-cutter ants to maintain an external microbial community with\r\nhigh plant biomass-degrading capacity likely represents a key step in the establishment of these\r\nants as widespread, dominant insect herbivores in the Neotropics. This system is an important model\r\nfor understanding how microbial communities degrade plant biomass in natural systems and has direct\r\nrelevancy for bioenergy, given recent interest in cellulosic biofuels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTaking a closer look: disentangling effects of functional diversity on ecosystem functions with a trait-based model across hierarchy and time\r\n\r\nBiodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) research has progressed from the detection of\r\nrelationships to elucidating their drivers and underlying mechanisms. In this context, replacing\r\ntaxonomic predictors by trait-based measures of functional composition (FC)â€”bridging functions of\r\nspecies and of ecosystemsâ€”is a widely used approach. The inherent challenge of trait-based\r\napproaches is the multi-faceted, dynamic and hierarchical nature of trait influence: (i) traits may\r\nact via different facets of their distribution in a community, (ii) their influence may change over\r\ntime and (iii) traits may influence processes at different levels of the natural hierarchy of\r\norganization. Here, we made use of the forest ecosystem model â€˜LPJ-GUESSâ€™ parametrized with\r\nempirical trait data, which creates output of individual performance, community assembly, stand-\r\nlevel states and processes. To address the three challenges, we resolved the dynamics of the top-\r\nlevel ecosystem function â€˜annual biomass changeâ€™ hierarchically into its various component processes\r\n(growth, leaf and root turnover, recruitment and mortality) and states (stand structures, water\r\nstress) and traced the influence of different facets of FC along this hierarchy in a path analysis.\r\nWe found an independent influence of functional richness, dissimilarity and identity on ecosystem\r\nstates and processes and hence biomass change. Biodiversity effects were only positive during early\r\nsuccession and later turned negative. Unexpectedly, resource acquisition (growth, recruitment) and\r\nconservation (mortality, turnover) played an equally important role throughout the succession.

Joint Carbon and Biodiversity Management in Tropical Agroforestry Landscapes Be Optimized?\r\n\r\nManaging ecosystems for carbon storage may also benefit biodiversity conservation, but such a\r\npotential â€˜win-winâ€™ scenario has not yet been assessed for tropical agroforestry landscapes. We\r\nmeasured above- and below-ground carbon stocks as well as the species richness of four groups of\r\nplants and eight of animals on 14 representative plots in Sulawesi, Indonesia, ranging from natural\r\nrainforest to cacao agroforests that have replaced former natural forest. The conversion of natural\r\nforests with carbon stocks of 227â€“362 Mg C haâˆ’1 to agroforests with 82â€“211 Mg C haâˆ’1 showed no\r\nrelationships to overall biodiversity but led to a significant loss of forest-related species\r\nrichness. We conclude that the conservation of the forest-related biodiversity, and to a lesser\r\ndegree of carbon stocks, mainly depends on the preservation of natural forest habitats. In the three\r\nmost carbon-rich agroforestry systems, carbon stocks were about 60% of those of natural forest,\r\nsuggesting that 1.6 ha of optimally managed agroforest can contribute to the conservation of carbon\r\nstocks as much as 1 ha of natural forest. However, agroforestry systems had comparatively low\r\nbiodiversity, and we found no evidence for a tight link between carbon storage and biodiversity.\r\nYet, potential win-win agroforestry management solutions include combining high shade-tree quality\r\nwhich favours biodiversity with cacao-yield adapted shade levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepresentation of Ecosystem Services by Terrestrial Protected Areas: Chile as a Case Study\r\n\r\nProtected areas are increasingly considered to play a key role in the global maintenance of\r\necosystem processes and the ecosystem services they provide. It is thus vital to assess the extent\r\nto which existing protected area systems represent those services. Here, for the first time, we\r\ndocument the effectiveness of the current Chilean protected area system and its planned extensions\r\nin representing both ecosystem services (plant productivity, carbon storage and agricultural\r\nproduction) and biodiversity. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of protected areas based\r\non their respective management objectives. Our results show that existing protected areas in Chile\r\ndo not contain an unusually high proportion of carbon storage (14.9%), agricultural production\r\n(0.2%) or biodiversity (11.8%), and also represent a low level of plant productivity (Normalized\r\nDifference Vegetation Index of 0.38). Proposed additional priority sites enhance the representation\r\nof ecosystem services and biodiversity, but not sufficiently to attain levels of representation\r\nhigher than would be expected for their area of coverage. Moreover, when the species groups were\r\nassessed separately, amphibians was the only one well represented. Suggested priority sites for\r\nbiodiversity conservation, without formal protection yet, was the only protected area category that\r\nover-represents carbon storage, agricultural production and biodiversity. The low representation of\r\necosystem services and speciesâ€™ distribution ranges by the current protected area system is because\r\nthese protected areas are heavily biased toward southern Chile, and contain large extents of ice and\r\nbare rock. The designation and management of proposed priority sites needs to be addressed in order\r\nto increase the representation of ecosystem services within the Chilean protected area system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReconciling agriculture, carbon and biodiversity in a savannah transformation frontier.\r\n\r\nRapidly rising populations and likely increases in incomes in sub-Saharan Africa make tens of\r\nmillions of hectares of cropland expansion nearly inevitable, even with large increases in crop\r\nyields. Much of that expansion is likely to occur in higher rainfall savannas, with substantial\r\ncosts to biodiversity and carbon storage. Zambia presents an acute example of this challenge, with\r\nan expected tripling of population by 2050, good potential to expand maize and soya bean production,\r\nand large areas of relatively undisturbed miombo woodland and associated habitat types of high\r\nbiodiversity value. Here, we present a new model designed to explore the potential for targeting\r\nagricultural expansion in ways that achieve quantitatively optimal trade-offs between competing\r\neconomic and environmental objectives: total converted land area (the reciprocal of potential\r\nyield); carbon loss, biodiversity loss and transportation costs. To allow different interests to\r\nfind potential compromises, users can apply varying weights to examine the effects of their\r\nsubjective preferences on the spatial allocation of new cropland and its costs. We find that small\r\ncompromises from the objective to convert the highest yielding areas permit large savings in\r\ntransportation costs, and the carbon and biodiversity impacts resulting from savannah conversion.\r\nFor example, transferring just 30% of weight from a yield-maximizing objective equally between\r\ncarbon and biodiversity protection objectives would increase total cropland area by just 2.7%, but\r\nresult in avoided costs of 27-47% for carbon, biodiversity and transportation. Compromise solutions\r\ntend to focus agricultural expansion along existing transportation corridors and in already\r\ndisturbed areas. Used appropriately, this type of model could help countries find agricultural\r\nexpansion alternatives and related infrastructure and land use policies that help achieve production\r\ntargets while helping to conserve Africa's rapidly transforming savannahs.This article is part of\r\nthe themed issue 'Tropical grassy biomes: linking ecology, human use and conservation'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon pools recover more quickly than plant biodiversity in tropical secondary forests.\r\n\r\nAlthough increasing efforts are being made to restore tropical forests, little information is\r\navailable regarding the time scales required for carbon and plant biodiversity to recover to the\r\nvalues associated with undisturbed forests. To address this knowledge gap, we carried out a meta-\r\nanalysis comparing data from more than 600 secondary tropical forest sites with nearby undisturbed\r\nreference forests. Above-ground biomass approached equivalence to reference values within 80 years\r\nsince last disturbance, whereas below-ground biomass took longer to recover. Soil carbon content\r\nshowed little relationship with time since disturbance. Tree species richness recovered after about\r\n50 years. By contrast, epiphyte richness did not reach equivalence to undisturbed forests. The\r\nproportion of undisturbed forest trees and epiphyte species found in secondary forests was low and\r\nchanged little over time. Our results indicate that carbon pools and biodiversity show different\r\nrecovery rates under passive, secondary succession and that colonization by undisturbed forest plant\r\nspecies is slow. Initiatives such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and REDD+ should\r\ntherefore encourage active management to help to achieve their aims of restoring both carbon and\r\nbiodiversity in tropical forests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarnessing carbon payments to protect biodiversity.\r\n\r\nInitiatives to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) are providing\r\nincreasing incentives for forest protection. The collateral benefits for biodiversity depend on the\r\nextent to which emissions reductions and biodiversity conservation can be achieved in the same\r\nplaces. Globally, we demonstrate spatial trade-offs in allocating funds to protect forests for\r\ncarbon and biodiversity and show that cost-effective spending for REDD would protect relatively few\r\nspecies of forest vertebrates. Because trade-offs are nonlinear, we discover that minor adjustments\r\nto the allocation of funds could double the biodiversity protected by REDD, while reducing carbon\r\noutcomes by only 4 to 8%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","entities":{"Thing":[{"indices":[10,16]},{"indices":[10,16]},{"indices":[21,33]},{"indices":[48,56]},{"indices":[57,69]},{"indices":[70,80]},{"indices":[107,117]},{"indices":[122,128],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[154,166],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[256,264],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[265,277],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[278,288],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[314,333]},{"indices":[327,333],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[356,363]},{"indices":[356,372]},{"indices":[364,372]},{"indices":[392,398]},{"indices":[412,419]},{"indices":[441,446]},{"indices":[484,491]},{"indices":[493,503]},{"indices":[513,524]},{"indices":[551,558],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[551,565]},{"indices":[559,565]},{"indices":[585,592],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[594,601]},{"indices":[607,613],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[649,660],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[723,735],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[769,775],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[784,791],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[793,801],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[844,850],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[859,871],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[900,906],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[953,960],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[953,967],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[961,967],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[968,976]},{"indices":[997,1003],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1009,1021],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1022,1029]},{"indices":[1031,1037],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1072,1079],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1072,1086],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1080,1086],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1133,1143]},{"indices":[1182,1188],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1216,1223],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1216,1230],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1224,1230],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1241,1253],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1254,1261],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1285,1297],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1349,1355],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1368,1380],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1406,1418],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1469,1473],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1469,1481],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1497,1509],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1574,1583]},{"indices":[1608,1623]},{"indices":[1618,1623]},{"indices":[1650,1665],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1660,1665],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1743,1752],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1771,1780],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1861,1875]},{"indices":[1871,1875],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1876,1883],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1990,2004],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2000,2004],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2005,2011],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2061,2070],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2081,2086]},{"indices":[2081,2099]},{"indices":[2101,2107],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2120,2132]},{"indices":[2150,2162],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2211,2226],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2221,2226],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2308,2323],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2318,2323],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2381,2387],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2405,2417],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2440,2452],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2496,2501],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2496,2514],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2539,2549],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2549,2549],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2595,2600],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2632,2641],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2655,2667],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2766,2770],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2803,2810],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2910,2915],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2921,2933],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2992,3006],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3002,3006],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3038,3044],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3054,3066],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3082,3094],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3123,3132],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3192,3206],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3202,3206],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3207,3213],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3232,3247],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3242,3247],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3302,3307],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3319,3322],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3333,3337],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3391,3396],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3463,3472],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3501,3515],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3511,3515],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3516,3522],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3543,3554],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3556,3562],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3567,3579],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3585,3593],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3684,3695],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3741,3749],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3789,3794],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3808,3812],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3812,3812],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3874,3882],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3883,3891

and Perceptions of Climate Change in a Biodiversity Conservation Hotspot\r\n\r\nQuantifying local people's perceptions to climate change, and their assessments of which changes\r\nmatter, is fundamental to addressing the dual challenge of land conservation and poverty alleviation\r\nin densely populated tropical regions To develop appropriate policies and responses, it will be\r\nimportant not only to anticipate the nature of expected changes, but also how they are perceived,\r\ninterpreted and adapted to by local residents. The Albertine Rift region in East Africa is one of\r\nthe world's most threatened biodiversity hotspots due to dense smallholder agriculture, high levels\r\nof land and resource pressures, and habitat loss and conversion. Results of three separate household\r\nsurveys conducted in the vicinity of Kibale National Park during the late 2000s indicate that\r\nfarmers are concerned with variable precipitation. Many survey respondents reported that conditions\r\nare drier and rainfall timing is becoming less predictable. Analysis of daily rainfall data for the\r\nclimate normal period 1981 to 2010 indicates that total rainfall both within and across seasons has\r\nnot changed significantly, although the timing and transitions of seasons has been highly variable.\r\nResults of rainfall data analysis also indicate significant changes in the intra-seasonal rainfall\r\ndistribution, including longer dry periods within rainy seasons, which may contribute to the\r\nperceived decrease in rainfall and can compromise food security. Our results highlight the need for\r\nfine-scale climate information to assist agro-ecological communities in developing effective\r\nadaptive management.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccommodating Species Climate-Forced Dispersal and Uncertainties in Spatial Conservation Planning\r\n\r\nAbstract Spatial conservation prioritization should seek to anticipate climate change impacts on\r\nbiodiversity and to mitigate these impacts through the development of dynamic conservation plans.\r\nHere, we defined spatial priorities for the conservation of amphibians inhabiting the Atlantic\r\nForest Biodiversity Hotspot that overcome the likely impacts of climate change on the distribution\r\nof this imperiled fauna. First, we built ecological niche models (ENMs) for 431 amphibian species\r\nboth for current time and for the mid-point of a 30-year period spanning 2071â€“2099 (i.e. 2080). For\r\nmodeling species' niches, we combined six modeling methods and three different climate models. We\r\nalso quantified and mapped model uncertainties. Our consensus models forecasted range shifts that\r\nculminate with high species richness in central and eastern Atlantic Forest, both for current time\r\nand for 2080. Most species had a significant range contraction (up to 72%) and 12% of species were\r\nprojected to be regionally extinct. Most species would need to disperse because suitable climatic\r\nsites will change. Therefore, we identified a network of priority sites for conservation that\r\nminimizes the distance a given species would need to disperse because of changes in future habitat\r\nsuitability (i.e. climate-forced dispersal) as well as uncertainties associated to ENMs. This\r\nnetwork also maximized complementary species representation across currently established protected\r\nareas. Priority sites already include possible dispersal corridors linking current and future\r\nsuitable habitats for amphibians. Although we used the a top-ranked Biodiversity Hotspot and\r\namphibians as a case study for illustrating our approach, our study may help developing more\r\neffective conservation strategies under climate change, especially when applied at different spatial\r\nscales, geographic regions, and taxonomic groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFour Decades of Andean Timberline Migration and Implications for Biodiversity Loss with Climate Change\r\n\r\nRapid 21st-century climate change may lead to large population decreases and extinction in tropical\r\nmontane cloud forest species in the Andes. While prior research has focused on species migrations\r\nper se, ecotones may respond to different environmental factors than species. Even if species can\r\nmigrate in response to climate change, if ecotones do not they can function as hard barriers to\r\nspecies migrations, making ecotone migrations central to understanding species persistence under\r\nscenarios of climate change. We examined a 42-year span of aerial photographs and high resolution\r\nsatellite imagery to calculate migration rates of timberlineâ€“the grassland-forest ecotoneâ€“inside and\r\noutside of protected areas in the high Peruvian Andes. We found that timberline in protected areas\r\nwas more likely to migrate upward in elevation than in areas with frequent cattle grazing and fire.\r\nHowever, rates in both protected (0.24 m yrâˆ’1) and unprotected (0.05 m yrâˆ’1) areas are only 0.5â€“2.3%\r\nof the rates needed to stay in equilibrium with projected climate by 2100. These ecotone migration\r\nrates are 12.5 to 110 times slower than the observed species migration rates within the same forest,\r\nsuggesting a barrier to migration for mid- and high-elevation species. We anticipate that the\r\necotone will be a hard barrier to migration under future climate change, leading to drastic\r\npopulation and biodiversity losses in the region unless intensive management steps are taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent models broadly neglect specific needs of biodiversity conservation in protected areas under climate change\r\n\r\nBackground Protected areas are the most common and important instrument for the conservation of\r\nbiological diversity and are called for under the United Nations' Convention on Biological\r\nDiversity. Growing human population densities, intensified land-use, invasive species and increasing\r\nhabitat fragmentation threaten ecosystems worldwide and protected areas are often the only refuge\r\nfor endangered species. Climate change is posing an additional threat that may also impact\r\necosystems currently under protection. Therefore, it is of crucial importance to include the\r\npotential impact of climate change when designing future nature conservation strategies and\r\nimplementing protected area management. This approach would go beyond reactive crisis management\r\nand, by necessity, would include anticipatory risk assessments. One avenue for doing so is being\r\nprovided by simulation models that take advantage of the increase in computing capacity and\r\nperformance that has occurred over the last two decades. Here we review the literature to determine\r\nthe state-of-the-art in modeling terrestrial protected areas under climate change, with the aim of\r\nevaluating and detecting trends and gaps in the current approaches being employed, as well as to\r\nprovide a useful overview and guidelines for future research. Results Most studies apply\r\nstatistical, bioclimatic envelope models and focus primarily on plant species as compared to other\r\ntaxa. Very few studies utilize a mechanistic, process-based approach and none examine biotic\r\ninteractions like predation and competition. Important factors like land-use, habitat fragmentation,\r\ninvasion and dispersal are rarely incorporated, restricting the informative value of the resulting\r\npredictions considerably. Conclusion The general impression that emerges is that biodiversity\r\nconservation in protected areas could benefit from the application of modern modeling approaches to\r\na greater extent than is currently reflected in the scientific literature. It is particularly true\r\nthat existing models have been underutilized in testing different management options under climate\r\nchange. Based on these findings we suggest a strategic framework for more effectively incorporating\r\nthe impact of climate change in models exploring the effectiveness of protected areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMapping the Drivers of Climate Change Vulnerability for Australiaâ€™s Threatened Species\r\n\r\nEffective conservation management for climate adaptation rests on understanding the factors driving\r\nspeciesâ€™ vulnerability in a spatially explicit manner so as to direct on-ground action. However,\r\nthere have been only few attempts to map the spatial distribution of the factors driving\r\nvulnerability to climate change. Here we conduct a species-level assessment of climate change\r\nvulnerability for a sample of Australiaâ€™s threatened species and map the distribution of species\r\naffected by each factor driving climate change vulnerability across the continent. Almost half of\r\nthe threatened species assessed were considered vulnerable to the impacts of climate change:\r\namphibians being the most vulnerable group, followed by plants, reptiles, mammals and birds. Species\r\nwith more restricted distributions were more likely to show high climate change vulnerability than\r\nwidespread species. The main factors driving climate change vulnerability were low genetic\r\nvariation, dependence on a particular disturbance regime and reliance on a particular moisture\r\nregime or habitat. The geographic distribution of the species impacted by each driver varies\r\nmarkedly across the continent, for example species impacted by low genetic variation are prevalent\r\nacross the human-dominated south-east of the country, while reliance on particular moisture regimes\r\nis prevalent across northern Australia.

Wide Consultation Help with Setting Priorities for Large-Scale Biodiversity Monitoring Programs?\r\n\r\nClimate and other global change phenomena affecting biodiversity require monitoring to track\r\necosystem changes and guide policy and management actions. Designing a biodiversity monitoring\r\nprogram is a difficult task that requires making decisions that often lack consensus due to\r\nbudgetary constrains. As monitoring programs require long-term investment, they also require strong\r\nand continuing support from all interested parties. As such, stakeholder consultation is key to\r\nidentify priorities and make sound design decisions that have as much support as possible. Here, we\r\npresent the results of a consultation conducted to serve as an aid for designing a large-scale\r\nbiodiversity monitoring program for the province of QuÃ©bec (Canada). The consultation took the form\r\nof a survey with 13 discrete choices involving tradeoffs in respect to design priorities and 10\r\ndemographic questions (e.g., age, profession). The survey was sent to thousands of individuals\r\nhaving expected interests and knowledge about biodiversity and was completed by 621 participants.\r\nOverall, consensuses were few and it appeared difficult to create a design fulfilling the priorities\r\nof the majority. Most participants wanted 1) a monitoring design covering the entire territory and\r\nfocusing on natural habitats; 2) a focus on species related to ecosystem services, on threatened and\r\non invasive species. The only demographic characteristic that was related to the type of\r\nprioritization was the declared level of knowledge in biodiversity (null to high), but even then the\r\ninfluence was quite small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies Richness and Trophic Diversity Increase Decomposition in a Co-Evolved Food Web\r\n\r\nEcological communities show great variation in species richness, composition and food web structure\r\nacross similar and diverse ecosystems. Knowledge of how this biodiversity relates to ecosystem\r\nfunctioning is important for understanding the maintenance of diversity and the potential effects of\r\nspecies losses and gains on ecosystems. While research often focuses on how variation in species\r\nrichness influences ecosystem processes, assessing species richness in a food web context can\r\nprovide further insight into the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning and\r\nelucidate potential mechanisms underpinning this relationship. Here, we assessed how species\r\nrichness and trophic diversity affect decomposition rates in a complete aquatic food web: the five\r\ntrophic level web that occurs within water-filled leaves of the northern pitcher plant, Sarracenia\r\npurpurea. We identified a trophic cascade in which top-predators â€” larvae of the pitcher-plant\r\nmosquito â€” indirectly increased bacterial decomposition by preying on bactivorous protozoa. Our data\r\nalso revealed a facultative relationship in which larvae of the pitcher-plant midge increased\r\nbacterial decomposition by shredding detritus. These important interactions occur only in food webs\r\nwith high trophic diversity, which in turn only occur in food webs with high species richness. We\r\nshow that species richness and trophic diversity underlie strong linkages between food web structure\r\nand dynamics that influence ecosystem functioning. The importance of trophic diversity and species\r\ninteractions in determining how biodiversity relates to ecosystem functioning suggests that simply\r\nfocusing on species richness does not give a complete picture as to how ecosystems may change with\r\nthe loss or gain of species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlant Diversity Impacts Decomposition and Herbivory via Changes in Aboveground Arthropods\r\n\r\nLoss of plant diversity influences essential ecosystem processes as aboveground productivity, and\r\ncan have cascading effects on the arthropod communities in adjacent trophic levels. However, few\r\nstudies have examined how those changes in arthropod communities can have additional impacts on\r\necosystem processes caused by them (e.g. pollination, bioturbation, predation, decomposition,\r\nherbivory). Therefore, including arthropod effects in predictions of the impact of plant diversity\r\nloss on such ecosystem processes is an important but little studied piece of information. In a\r\ngrassland biodiversity experiment, we addressed this gap by assessing aboveground decomposer and\r\nherbivore communities and linking their abundance and diversity to rates of decomposition and\r\nherbivory. Path analyses showed that increasing plant diversity led to higher abundance and\r\ndiversity of decomposing arthropods through higher plant biomass. Higher species richness of\r\ndecomposers, in turn, enhanced decomposition. Similarly, species-rich plant communities hosted a\r\nhigher abundance and diversity of herbivores through elevated plant biomass and C:N ratio, leading\r\nto higher herbivory rates. Integrating trophic interactions into the study of biodiversity effects\r\nis required to understand the multiple pathways by which biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInconsistent impacts of decomposer diversity on the stability of aboveground and belowground ecosystem functions\r\n\r\nThe intensive discussion on the importance of biodiversity for the stability of essential processes\r\nin ecosystems has prompted a multitude of studies since the middle of the last century.\r\nNevertheless, research has been extremely biased by focusing on the producer level, while studies on\r\nthe impacts of decomposer diversity on the stability of ecosystem functions are lacking. Here, we\r\ninvestigate the impacts of decomposer diversity on the stability (reliability) of three important\r\naboveground and belowground ecosystem functions: primary productivity (shoot and root biomass),\r\nlitter decomposition, and herbivore infestation. For this, we analyzed the results of three\r\nlaboratory experiments manipulating decomposer diversity (1â€“3 species) in comparison to decomposer-\r\nfree treatments in terms of variability of the measured variables. Decomposer diversity often\r\nsignificantly but inconsistently affected the stability of all aboveground and belowground ecosystem\r\nfunctions investigated in the present study. While primary productivity was mainly destabilized,\r\nlitter decomposition and aphid infestation were essentially stabilized by increasing decomposer\r\ndiversity. However, impacts of decomposer diversity varied between plant community and fertility\r\ntreatments. There was no general effect of the presence of decomposers on stability and no trend\r\ntoward weaker effects in fertilized communities and legume communities. This indicates that impacts\r\nof decomposers are based on more than effects on nutrient availability. Although inconsistent\r\nimpacts complicate the estimation of consequences of belowground diversity loss, underpinning\r\nmechanisms of the observed patterns are discussed. Impacts of decomposer diversity on the stability\r\nof essential ecosystem functions differed between plant communities of varying composition and\r\nfertility, implicating that human-induced changes of biodiversity and land-use management might have\r\nunpredictable effects on the processes mankind relies on. This study therefore points to the\r\nnecessity of also considering soil feedback mechanisms in order to gain a comprehensive and holistic\r\nunderstanding of the impacts of current global change phenomena on the stability of essential\r\necosystem functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of latitudinal gradient on the species diversity of Chinese litter-dwelling thrips\r\n\r\nTo understand the global distribution patterns of litter-dwelling thrips, a total 150 leaf litter\r\nsamples were collected from 6 natural reserves located in three climatic regions, temperate,\r\nsubtropical and tropical. The results showed the relative abundance of Thysanoptera was over 3.0% in\r\n4 natural reserves from subtropical and tropical zone, and reached 5.9% in one tropical reserve,\r\nonly less than Acarina and Collembola. In contrast it was only 0.3% in the warm temperate natural\r\nreserves, and no thrips were collected in a mid temperate reserve. The order on the average species\r\nnumbers per plot of litter thrips was tropic &gt; subtropics &gt; temperate (n=25, p&lt;0.05). Mean density\r\nof litter thrips per plots in the tropics and subtropics was significantly higher than that in the\r\ntemperate region (n=25, p&lt;0.05), but the average density was not significantly different between\r\ntropical and subtropical zones (n=25, p&gt;0.05). The diversity of litter thrips in the tropics and\r\nsubtropics was much higher than that in the temperate area based on comparsions of Shannon-Wiener\r\ndiversity index (Hâ€™), Pielou eveness index (J), and Simpson dominance index (D).

of an invasive slug is affected by earthworms and the composition of plant communities\r\n\r\nBackground Biodiversity loss and species invasions are among the most important human-induced global\r\nchanges. Moreover, these two processes are interlinked as ecosystem invasibility is considered to\r\nincrease with decreasing biodiversity. In temperate grasslands, earthworms serve as important\r\necosystem engineers making up the majority of soil faunal biomass. Herbivore behaviour has been\r\nshown to be affected by earthworms, however it is unclear whether these effects differ with the\r\ncomposition of plant communities. To test this we conducted a mesocosm experiment where we added\r\nearthworms (Annelida: Lumbricidae) to planted grassland communities with different plant species\r\ncomposition (3 vs. 12 plant spp.). Plant communities had equal plant densities and ratios of the\r\nfunctional groups grasses, non-leguminous forbs and legumes. Later, Arion vulgaris slugs (formerly\r\nknown as A. lusitanicus; Gastropoda: Arionidae) were added and allowed to freely choose among the\r\navailable plant species. This slug species is listed among the 100 worst alien species in Europe. We\r\nhypothesized that (i) the food choice of slugs would be altered by earthwormsâ€™ specific effects on\r\nthe growth and nutrient content of plant species, (ii) slug herbivory will be less affected by\r\nearthworms in plant communities containing more plant species than in those with fewer plant species\r\nbecause of a more readily utilization of plant resources making the impacts of earthworms less\r\npronounced. Results Slug herbivory was significantly affected by both earthworms and plant species\r\ncomposition. Slugs damaged 60% less leaves when earthworms were present, regardless of the species\r\ncomposition of the plant communities. Percent leaf area consumed by slugs was 40% lower in\r\ncommunities containing 12 plant species; in communities containing only three species earthworms\r\nincreased slug leaf area consumption. Grasses were generally avoided by slugs. Leaf length and\r\nnumber of tillers was increased in mesocosms containing more plant species but little influenced by\r\nearthworms. Overall shoot biomass was decreased, root biomass increased in plant communities with\r\nmore plant species. Earthworms decreased total shoot biomass in mesocosms with more plant species\r\nbut did not affect biomass production of individual functional groups. Plant nitrogen concentrations\r\nacross three focus species were 18% higher when earthworms were present; composition of plant\r\ncommunities did not affect plant quality. Conclusions Given the important role that both herbivores\r\nand earthworms play in structuring plant communities the implications of belowground-aboveground\r\nlinkages should more broadly be considered when investigating global change effects on ecosystems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvasive earthworms erode soil biodiversity: A meta-analysis.\r\n\r\nBiological invasions pose a serious threat to biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across\r\necosystems. Invasions by ecosystem engineers, in particular, have been shown to have dramatic\r\neffects in recipient ecosystems. For instance, invasion by earthworms, a below-ground invertebrate\r\necosystem engineer, in previously earthworm-free ecosystems alters the physico-chemical\r\ncharacteristics of the soil. Studies have shown that such alterations in the soil can have far-\r\nreaching impacts on soil organisms, which form a major portion of terrestrial biodiversity. Here, we\r\npresent the first quantitative synthesis of earthworm invasion effects on soil micro-organisms and\r\nsoil invertebrates based on 430 observations from 30 independent studies. Our meta-analysis shows a\r\nsignificant decline of the diversity and density of soil invertebrates in response to earthworm\r\ninvasion with anecic and endogeic earthworms causing the strongest effects. Earthworm invasion\r\neffects on soil micro-organisms were context-dependent, such as depending on functional group\r\nrichness of invasive earthworms and soil depth. Microbial biomass and diversity increased in mineral\r\nsoil layers, with a weak negative effect in organic soil layers, indicating that the mixing of soil\r\nlayers by earthworms (bioturbation) may homogenize microbial communities across soil layers. Our\r\nmeta-analysis provides a compelling evidence for negative effects of a common invasive below-ground\r\necosystem engineer on below-ground biodiversity of recipient ecosystems, which could potentially\r\nalter the ecosystem functions and services linked to soil biota.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEffect of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) on a soil-biota system: Role of earthworms and ryegrass.\r\n\r\nIn the present study, the toxic effect of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209), an important brominated\r\nfire retardant, on soil was evaluated by amending with different concentrations (0â€‰mg/kg, 1â€‰mg/kg,\r\n10â€‰mg/kg, and 500â€‰mg/kg dry wt) for 40â€‰d. The activities of 3 soil enzymes (urease, catalase, and\r\nalkaline phosphatase) were measured as the principal assessment endpoints. Meanwhile, the effects of\r\nnatural environmental factors, such as light conditions and soil biota, on BDE-209 intoxication were\r\nstudied. For the latter, 30 earthworms (Metaphire guillelmi) with fully matured clitella or ryegrass\r\n(Lolium perenne) with fully matured leaves were exposed in soil amended with BDE-209. The activities\r\nof the soil enzymes were adversely affected by BDE-209, especially for the high-concentration\r\ntreatments, with greater adverse effects in the dark than in the light. The presence of earthworms\r\nreduced toxicity to BDE-209, whereas ryegrass did not. The calculated integrated biomarker response\r\nindex, which provides a general indicator of the health status of test species by combining\r\ndifferent biomarker signals, further validated these findings. Moreover, the antioxidant status\r\n(oxidant-antioxidant balance) of these 2 biota was assessed. Results indicated that BDE-209\r\nsignificantly affected the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase and catalase) and\r\nenhanced the levels of malondialdehyde in both species. The present study may facilitate a better\r\nunderstanding of the toxicity of BDE-209 toward the soil environment. Environ Toxicol Chem\r\n2016;35:1349-1357.

This work is aimed to compare the innate defense mechanisms of two closely\r\nrelated earthworm species, Eisenia andrei and Eisenia fetida, that inhabit substantially different\r\necological niches. While E. andrei lives in a compost and manure, E. fetida can be found in the\r\nlitter layer in forests. Therefore, the influence of environment-specific microbiota on the immune\r\nresponse of both species was followed. Firstly, a reliable method to discern between E. andrei and\r\nE. fetida based on species-specific primers for cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and stringent PCR\r\nconditions was developed. Secondly, to analyze the immunological profile in both earthworm species,\r\nthe activity and expression of lysozyme, pattern recognition protein CCF, and antimicrobial proteins\r\nwith hemolytic function, fetidin and lysenins, have been assessed. Whereas, CCF and lysozyme showed\r\nonly slight differences in the expression and activity, fetidin/lysenins expression as well as the\r\nhemolytic activity was considerably higher in E. andrei as compared to E. fetida. The expression of\r\nfetidin/lysenins in E. fetida was not affected upon the challenge with compost microbiota,\r\nsuggesting more substantial changes in the regulation of the gene expression. Genomic DNA analyses\r\nrevealed significantly higher level of fetidin/lysenins (determined using universal primer pairs) in\r\nE. andrei compared to E. fetida. It can be hypothesized that E. andrei colonizing compost as a new\r\nhabitat acquired an evolutionary selection advantage resulting in a higher expression of\r\nantimicrobial proteins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLand-use and land-management change: relationships with earthworm and fungi communities and soil structural properties\r\n\r\nBackground Change in land use and management can impact massively on soil ecosystems. Ecosystem\r\nengineers and other functional biodiversity in soils can be influenced directly by such change and\r\nthis in turn can affect key soil functions. Here, we employ meta-analysis to provide a quantitative\r\nassessment of the effects of changes in land use and land management across a range of\r\nsuccessional/extensification transitions (conventional arableâ€‰â†’â€‰no or reduced\r\ntillageâ€‰â†’â€‰grasslandâ€‰â†’â€‰wooded land) on community metrics for two functionally important soil taxa,\r\nearthworms and fungi. An analysis of the relationships between community change and soil structural\r\nproperties was also included. Results Meta-analysis highlighted a consistent trend of increased\r\nearthworm and fungal community abundances and complexity following transitions to lower intensity\r\nand later successional land uses. The greatest changes were seen for early stage transitions, such\r\nas introduction of reduced tillage regimes and conversion to grassland from arable land. Not all\r\nchanges, however, result in positive effects on the assessed community metrics. For example, whether\r\nwoodland conversion positively or negatively affects community size and complexity depends on\r\nwoodland type and, potentially, the changes in soil properties, such as pH, that may occur during\r\nconversion. Alterations in soil communities tended to facilitate subsequent changes in soil\r\nstructure and hydrology. For example, increasing earthworm abundances and functional group\r\ncomposition were shown to be positively correlated with water infiltration rate (dependent on\r\ntillage regime and habitat characteristics); while positive changes in fungal biomass measures were\r\npositively associated with soil microaggregate stability. Conclusions These findings raise the\r\npotential to manage landscapes to increase ecosystem service provision from soil biota in relation\r\nto regulation of soil structure and water

approaches for understanding microbial biodiversity and ecosystem functioning\r\n\r\nIn ecology, biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) research has seen a shift in perspective from\r\ntaxonomy to function in the last two decades, with successful application of trait-based approaches.\r\nThis shift offers opportunities for a deeper mechanistic understanding of the role of biodiversity\r\nin maintaining multiple ecosystem processes and services. In this paper, we highlight studies that\r\nhave focused on BEF of microbial communities with an emphasis on integrating trait-based approaches\r\nto microbial ecology. In doing so, we explore some of the inherent challenges and opportunities of\r\nunderstanding BEF using microbial systems. For example, microbial biologists characterize\r\ncommunities using gene phylogenies that are often unable to resolve functional traits. Additionally,\r\nexperimental designs of existing microbial BEF studies are often inadequate to unravel BEF\r\nrelationships. We argue that combining eco-physiological studies with contemporary molecular tools\r\nin a trait-based framework can reinforce our ability to link microbial diversity to ecosystem\r\nprocesses. We conclude that such trait-based approaches are a promising framework to increase the\r\nunderstanding of microbial BEF relationships and thus generating systematic principles in microbial\r\necology and more generally ecology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLinking biodiversity and ecosystems: towards a unifying ecological theory\r\n\r\nCommunity ecology and ecosystem ecology provide two perspectives on complex ecological systems that\r\nhave largely complementary strengths and weaknesses. Merging the two perspectives is necessary both\r\nto ensure continued scientific progress and to provide society with the scientific means to face\r\ngrowing environmental challenges. Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has\r\ncontributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both\r\nscience and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments,\r\nby building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented\r\ndisciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it\r\nhas helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary\r\necosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics\r\nof species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this\r\nmuch-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines. Recent community evolution models\r\nare a promising step in that direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA review of malaria transmission dynamics in forest ecosystems\r\n\r\nMalaria continues to be a major health problem in more than 100 endemic countries located primarily\r\nin tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world. Malaria transmission is a dynamic process and\r\ninvolves many interlinked factors, from uncontrollable natural environmental conditions to man-made\r\ndisturbances to nature. Almost half of the population at risk of malaria lives in forest areas.\r\nForests are hot beds of malaria transmission as they provide conditions such as vegetation cover,\r\ntemperature, rainfall and humidity conditions that are conducive to distribution and survival of\r\nmalaria vectors. Forests often lack infrastructure and harbor tribes with distinct genetic traits,\r\nsocio-cultural beliefs and practices that greatly influence malaria transmission dynamics. Here we\r\nsummarize the various topographical, entomological, parasitological, human ecological and socio-\r\neconomic factors, which are crucial and shape malaria transmission in forested areas. An in-depth\r\nunderstanding and synthesis of the intricate relationship of these parameters in achieving better\r\nmalaria control in various types of forest ecosystems is emphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHigh-resolution deep sequencing reveals biodiversity, population structure, and persistence of HIV-1 quasispecies within host ecosystems\r\n\r\nBackground Deep sequencing provides the basis for analysis of biodiversity of taxonomically similar\r\norganisms in an environment. While extensively applied to microbiome studies, population genetics\r\nstudies of viruses are limited. To define the scope of HIV-1 population biodiversity within infected\r\nindividuals, a suite of phylogenetic and population genetic algorithms was applied to HIV-1 envelope\r\nhypervariable domain 3 (Env V3) within peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a group of\r\nperinatally HIV-1 subtype B infected, therapy-naÃ¯ve children. Results Biodiversity of HIV-1 Env V3\r\nquasispecies ranged from about 70 to 270 unique sequence clusters across individuals. Viral\r\npopulation structure was organized into a limited number of clusters that included the dominant\r\nvariants combined with multiple clusters of low frequency variants. Next generation viral\r\nquasispecies evolved from low frequency variants at earlier time points through multiple non-\r\nsynonymous changes in lineages within the evolutionary landscape. Minor V3 variants detected as long\r\nas four years after infection co-localized in phylogenetic reconstructions with early transmitting\r\nviruses or with subsequent plasma virus circulating two years later. Conclusions Deep sequencing\r\ndefines HIV-1 population complexity and structure, reveals the ebb and flow of dominant and rare\r\nviral variants in the host ecosystem, and identifies an evolutionary record of low-frequency cell-\r\nassociated viral V3 variants that persist for years. Bioinformatics pipeline developed for HIV-1 can\r\nbe applied for biodiversity studies of virome populations in human, animal, or plant ecosystems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpatiotemporal modulation of biodiversity in a synthetic chemical-mediated ecosystem\r\n\r\nBiodiversity, or the relative abundance of species, measures the persistence of an ecosystem. To\r\nbetter understand its modulation, we analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of a synthetic,\r\nchemical-mediated ecosystem that consisted of two engineered Escherichia coli populations. Depending\r\non the specific experimental conditions implemented, the dominant interaction between the two\r\npopulations could be competition for nutrients or predation due to engineered communication. While\r\nthe two types of interactions resulted in different spatial patterns, they demonstrated a common\r\ntrend in terms of the modulation of biodiversity. Specifically, biodiversity decreased with\r\nincreasing cellular motility if the segregation distance between the two populations was comparable\r\nto the length scale of the chemical-mediated interaction.

Fishes in Biodiversity Hotspots Are at Greatest Risk from Loss of Coral Species\r\n\r\nCoral reef ecosystems are under a variety of threats from global change and anthropogenic\r\ndisturbances that are reducing the number and type of coral species on reefs. Coral reefs support\r\nupwards of one third of all marine species of fish, so the loss of coral habitat may have\r\nsubstantial consequences to local fish diversity. We posit that the effects of habitat degradation\r\nwill be most severe in coral regions with highest biodiversity of fishes due to greater\r\nspecialization by fishes for particular coral habitats. Our novel approach to this important but\r\nuntested hypothesis was to conduct the same field experiment at three geographic locations across\r\nthe Indo-Pacific biodiversity gradient (Papua New Guinea; Great Barrier Reef, Australia; French\r\nPolynesia). Specifically, we experimentally explored whether the response of local fish communities\r\nto identical changes in diversity of habitat-providing corals was independent of the size of the\r\nregional species pool of fishes. We found that the proportional reduction (sensitivity) in fish\r\nbiodiversity to loss of coral diversity was greater for regions with larger background species\r\npools, reflecting variation in the degree of habitat specialization of fishes across the Indo-\r\nPacific diversity gradient. This result implies that habitat-associated fish in diversity hotspots\r\nare at greater risk of local extinction to a given loss of habitat diversity compared to regions\r\nwith lower species richness. This mechanism, related to the positive relationship between habitat\r\nspecialization and regional biodiversity, and the elevated extinction risk this poses for\r\nbiodiversity hotspots, may apply to species in other types of ecosystems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA New Freshwater Biodiversity Indicator Based on Fish Community Assemblages\r\n\r\nBiodiversity has reached a critical state. In this context, stakeholders need indicators that both\r\nprovide a synthetic view of the state of biodiversity and can be used as communication tools. Using\r\nriver fishes as model, we developed community indicators that aim at integrating various components\r\nof biodiversity including interactions between species and ultimately the processes influencing\r\necosystem functions. We developed indices at the species level based on (i) the concept of\r\nspecialization directly linked to the niche theory and (ii) the concept of originality measuring the\r\noverall degree of differences between a species and all other species in the same clade. Five major\r\ntypes of originality indices, based on phylogeny, habitat-linked and diet-linked morphology, life\r\nhistory traits, and ecological niche were analyzed. In a second step, we tested the relationship\r\nbetween all biodiversity indices and land use as a proxy of human pressures. Fish communities showed\r\nno significant temporal trend for most of these indices, but both originality indices based on diet-\r\nand habitat- linked morphology showed a significant increase through time. From a spatial point of\r\nview, all indices clearly singled out Corsica Island as having higher average originality and\r\nspecialization. Finally, we observed that the originality index based on niche traits might be used\r\nas an informative biodiversity indicator because we showed it is sensitive to different land use\r\nclasses along a landscape artificialization gradient. Moreover, its response remained unchanged over\r\ntwo other land use classifications at the global scale and also at the regional scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Biodiversity of the Mediterranean Sea: Estimates, Patterns, and Threats\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean Sea is a marine biodiversity hot spot. Here we combined an extensive literature\r\nanalysis with expert opinions to update publicly available estimates of major taxa in this marine\r\necosystem and to revise and update several species lists. We also assessed overall spatial and\r\ntemporal patterns of species diversity and identified major changes and threats. Our results listed\r\napproximately 17,000 marine species occurring in the Mediterranean Sea. However, our estimates of\r\nmarine diversity are still incomplete as yetâ€”undescribed species will be added in the future.\r\nDiversity for microbes is substantially underestimated, and the deep-sea areas and portions of the\r\nsouthern and eastern region are still poorly known. In addition, the invasion of alien species is a\r\ncrucial factor that will continue to change the biodiversity of the Mediterranean, mainly in its\r\neastern basin that can spread rapidly northwards and westwards due to the warming of the\r\nMediterranean Sea. Spatial patterns showed a general decrease in biodiversity from northwestern to\r\nsoutheastern regions following a gradient of production, with some exceptions and caution due to\r\ngaps in our knowledge of the biota along the southern and eastern rims. Biodiversity was also\r\ngenerally higher in coastal areas and continental shelves, and decreases with depth. Temporal trends\r\nindicated that overexploitation and habitat loss have been the main human drivers of historical\r\nchanges in biodiversity. At present, habitat loss and degradation, followed by fishing impacts,\r\npollution, climate change, eutrophication, and the establishment of alien species are the most\r\nimportant threats and affect the greatest number of taxonomic groups. All these impacts are expected\r\nto grow in importance in the future, especially climate change and habitat degradation. The spatial\r\nidentification of hot spots highlighted the ecological importance of most of the western\r\nMediterranean shelves (and in particular, the Strait of Gibraltar and the adjacent Alboran Sea),\r\nwestern African coast, the Adriatic, and the Aegean Sea, which show high concentrations of\r\nendangered, threatened, or vulnerable species. The Levantine Basin, severely impacted by the\r\ninvasion of species, is endangered as well.

Species number is frequently used as a metric for conservation\r\nprioritization and monitoring changes in ecosystem health. We conducted a series of synoptic surveys\r\nfocusing on the fishes of the Bootless Bay region of Papua New Guinea to generate a checklist of\r\nfishes of the region. Bootless Bay lies directly south of Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New\r\nGuinea, and experiences the highest human population density of any marine area in the country. Our\r\nchecklist will set a baseline against which future environmental changes can be tracked. Results We\r\ngenerated a checklist of 488 fish species in 72 families found in Bootless Bay during a two-week\r\nsampling effort. Using incident-based methods of species estimation, we extrapolate there to be\r\napproximately 940 fish species in Bootless Bay, one of the lowest reported numbers in Papua New\r\nGuinea. Conclusions Our data suggest that the Bootless Bay ecosystem of Papua New Guinea, while\r\ndiverse in absolute terms, has lower fish biodiversity compared to other shallow marine areas within\r\nthe country. These differences in faunal diversity are most likely a combination of unequal sampling\r\neffort as well as biophysical factors within Bootless Bay compounded by historical and/or\r\ncontemporary anthropogenic disturbances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRevealing the Appetite of the Marine Aquarium Fish Trade: The Volume and Biodiversity of Fish Imported into the United States\r\n\r\nThe aquarium trade and other wildlife consumers are at a crossroads forced by threats from global\r\nclimate change and other anthropogenic stressors that have weakened coastal ecosystems. While the\r\nwildlife trade may put additional stress on coral reefs, it brings income into impoverished parts of\r\nthe world and may stimulate interest in marine conservation. To better understand the influence of\r\nthe trade, we must first be able to quantify coral reef fauna moving through it. Herein, we discuss\r\nthe lack of a data system for monitoring the wildlife aquarium trade and analyze problems that arise\r\nwhen trying to monitor the trade using a system not specifically designed for this purpose. To do\r\nthis, we examined an entire year of import records of marine tropical fish entering the United\r\nStates in detail, and discuss the relationship between trade volume, biodiversity and introduction\r\nof non-native marine fishes. Our analyses showed that biodiversity levels are higher than previous\r\nestimates. Additionally, more than half of government importation forms have numerical or other\r\nreporting discrepancies resulting in the overestimation of trade volumes by 27%. While some commonly\r\nimported species have been introduced into the coastal waters of the USA (as expected), we also\r\nfound that some uncommon species in the trade have also been introduced. This is the first study of\r\naquarium trade imports to compare commercial invoices to government forms and provides a means to,\r\nroutinely and in real time, examine the biodiversity of the trade in

restoration, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning\r\n\r\nGlobally, forests cover nearly one third of the land area and they contain over 80% of terrestrial\r\nbiodiversity. Both the extent and quality of forest habitat continue to decrease and the associated\r\nloss of biodiversity jeopardizes forest ecosystem functioning and the ability of forests to provide\r\necosystem services. In the light of the increasing population pressure, it is of major importance\r\nnot only to conserve, but also to restore forest ecosystems. Ecological restoration has recently\r\nstarted to adopt insights from the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) perspective. Central is\r\nthe focus on restoring the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here we provide\r\nan overview of important considerations related to forest restoration that can be inferred from this\r\nBEF-perspective. Restoring multiple forest functions requires multiple species. It is highly\r\nunlikely that species-poor plantations, which may be optimal for above-ground biomass production,\r\nwill outperform species diverse assemblages for a combination of functions, including overall carbon\r\nstorage and control over water and nutrient flows. Restoring stable forest functions also requires\r\nmultiple species. In particular in the light of global climatic change scenarios, which predict more\r\nfrequent extreme disturbances and climatic events, it is important to incorporate insights from the\r\nrelation between biodiversity and stability of ecosystem functioning into forest restoration\r\nprojects. Rather than focussing on species per se, focussing on functional diversity of tree species\r\nassemblages seems appropriate when selecting tree species for restoration. Finally, also plant\r\ngenetic diversity and above - below-ground linkages should be considered during the restoration\r\nprocess, as these likely have prominent but until now poorly understood effects at the level of the\r\necosystem. The BEF-approach provides a useful framework to evaluate forest restoration in an\r\necosystem functioning context, but it also highlights that much remains to be understood, especially\r\nregarding the relation between forest functioning on the one side and genetic diversity and above-\r\nground-below-ground species associations on the other. The strong emphasis of the BEF-approach on\r\nfunctional rather than taxonomic diversity may also be the beginning of a paradigm shift in\r\nrestoration ecology, increasing the tolerance towards allochthonous species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPervasive Defaunation of Forest Remnants in a Tropical Biodiversity Hotspot\r\n\r\nTropical deforestation and forest fragmentation are among the most important biodiversity\r\nconservation issues worldwide, yet local extinctions of millions of animal and plant populations\r\nstranded in unprotected forest remnants remain poorly explained. Here, we report unprecedented rates\r\nof local extinctions of medium to large-bodied mammals in one of the world's most important tropical\r\nbiodiversity hotspots. We scrutinized 8,846 person-years of local knowledge to derive patch\r\noccupancy data for 18 mammal species within 196 forest patches across a 252,669-km2 study region of\r\nthe Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We uncovered a staggering rate of local extinctions in the mammal\r\nfauna, with only 767 from a possible 3,528 populations still persisting. On average, forest patches\r\nretained 3.9 out of 18 potential species occupancies, and geographic ranges had contracted to\r\n0â€“14.4% of their former distributions, including five large-bodied species that had been extirpated\r\nat a regional scale. Forest fragments were highly accessible to hunters and exposed to edge effects\r\nand fires, thereby severely diminishing the predictive power of species-area relationships, with the\r\npower model explaining only âˆ¼9% of the variation in species richness per patch. Hence, conventional\r\nspecies-area curves provided over-optimistic estimates of species persistence in that most forest\r\nfragments had lost species at a much faster rate than predicted by habitat loss alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan retention forestry help conserve biodiversity? A meta-analysis\r\n\r\n Industrial forestry typically leads to a simplified forest structure and altered species\r\ncomposition. Retention of trees at harvest was introduced about 25Â years ago to mitigate negative\r\nimpacts on biodiversity, mainly from clearcutting, and is now widely practiced in boreal and\r\ntemperate regions. Despite numerous studies on response of flora and fauna to retention, no\r\ncomprehensive review has summarized its effects on biodiversity in comparison to clearcuts as well\r\nas un-harvested forests.   Using a systematic review protocol, we completed a meta-analysis of 78\r\nstudies including 944 comparisons of biodiversity between retention cuts and either clearcuts or un-\r\nharvested forests, with the main objective of assessing whether retention forestry helps, at least\r\nin the short term, to moderate the negative effects of clearcutting on flora and fauna.   Retention\r\ncuts supported higher richness and a greater abundance of forest species than clearcuts as well as\r\nhigher richness and abundance of open-habitat species than un-harvested forests. For all species\r\ntaken together (i.e. forest species, open-habitat species, generalist species and unclassified\r\nspecies), richness was higher in retention cuts than in clearcuts.   Retention cuts had negative\r\nimpacts on some species compared to un-harvested forest, indicating that certain forest-interior\r\nspecies may not survive in retention cuts. Similarly, retention cuts were less suitable for some\r\nopen-habitat species compared with clearcuts.   Positive effects of retention cuts on richness of\r\nforest species increased with proportion of retained trees and time since harvest, but there were\r\nnot enough data to analyse possible threshold effects, that is, levels at which effects on\r\nbiodiversity diminish. Spatial arrangement of the trees (aggregated vs. dispersed) had no effect on\r\neither forest species or open-habitat species, although limited data may have hindered our capacity\r\nto identify responses. Results for different comparisons were largely consistent among taxonomic\r\ngroups for forest and open-habitat species, respectively.   Synthesis and applications. Our meta-\r\nanalysis provides support for wider use of retention forestry since it moderates negative harvesting\r\nimpacts on biodiversity. Hence, it is a promising approach for integrating biodiversity conservation\r\nand production forestry, although identifying optimal solutions between these two goals may need\r\nfurther attention. Nevertheless, retention forestry will not substitute for conservation actions\r\ntargeting certain highly specialized species associated with forest-interior or open-habitat\r\nconditions.    Our meta-analysis provides support for wider use of retention forestry since it\r\nmoderates negative harvesting impacts on biodiversity. Hence, it is a promising approach for\r\nintegrating biodiversity conservation and production forestry, although identifying optimal\r\nsolutions between these two goals may need further attention. Nevertheless, retention forestry will\r\nnot substitute for conservation actions targeting certain highly specialized species associated with\r\nforest-interior or open-habitat conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA global model of the response of tropical and sub-tropical forest biodiversity to anthropogenic pressures\r\n\r\nHabitat loss and degradation, driven largely by agricultural expansion and intensification, present\r\nthe greatest immediate threat to biodiversity. Tropical forests harbour among the highest levels of\r\nterrestrial species diversity and are likely to experience rapid land-use change in the coming\r\ndecades. Synthetic analyses of observed responses of species are useful for quantifying how land use\r\naffects biodiversity and for predicting outcomes under land-use scenarios. Previous applications of\r\nthis approach have typically focused on individual taxonomic groups, analysing the average response\r\nof the whole community to changes in land use. Here, we incorporate quantitative remotely sensed\r\ndata about habitats in, to our knowledge, the first worldwide synthetic analysis of how individual\r\nspecies in four major taxonomic groupsâ€”invertebrates, â€˜herptilesâ€™ (reptiles and amphibians), mammals\r\nand birdsâ€”respond to multiple human pressures in tropical and sub-tropical forests. We show\r\nsignificant independent impacts of land use, human vegetation offtake, forest cover and human\r\npopulation density on both occurrence and abundance of species, highlighting the value of analysing\r\nmultiple explanatory variables simultaneously. Responses differ among the four groups considered,\r\nandâ€”within birds and mammalsâ€”between habitat specialists and habitat generalists and between narrow-\r\nranged and wide-ranged species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForest Loss and the Biodiversity Threshold: An Evaluation Considering Species Habitat Requirements and the Use of Matrix Habitats\r\n\r\nHabitat loss is the main driver of the current biodiversity crisis, a landscape-scale process that\r\naffects the survival of spatially-structured populations. Although it is well-established that\r\nspecies responses to habitat loss can be abrupt, the existence of a biodiversity threshold is still\r\nthe cause of much controversy in the literature and would require that most species respond\r\nsimilarly to the loss of native vegetation. Here we test the existence of a biodiversity threshold,\r\ni.e. an abrupt decline in species richness, with habitat loss. We draw on a spatially-replicated\r\ndataset on Atlantic forest small mammals, consisting of 16 sampling sites divided between forests\r\nand matrix habitats in each of five 3600-ha landscapes (varying from 5% to 45% forest cover), and on\r\nan a priori classification of species into habitat requirement categories (forest specialists,\r\nhabitat generalists and open-area specialists). Forest specialists declined abruptly below 30% of\r\nforest cover, and spillover to the matrix occurred only in more forested landscapes. Generalists\r\nresponded positively to landscape heterogeneity, peaking at intermediary levels of forest cover.\r\nOpen area specialists dominated the matrix and did not spillover to forests. As a result of these\r\ndistinct responses, we observed a biodiversity threshold for the small mammal community below 30%\r\nforest cover, and a peak in species richness just above this threshold. Our results highlight that\r\ncross habitat spillover may be asymmetrical and contingent on landscape context, occurring mainly\r\nfrom forests to the matrix and only in more forested landscapes. Moreover, they indicate the\r\npotential for biodiversity thresholds in human-modified landscapes, and the importance of landscape\r\nheterogeneity to biodiversity.

of genes encoding anti-microbial traits within plant associated microbes\r\n\r\nThe plant is an attractive versatile home for diverse associated microbes. A subset of these\r\nmicrobes produces a diversity of anti-microbial natural products including polyketides, non-\r\nribosomal peptides, terpenoids, heterocylic nitrogenous compounds, volatile compounds, bacteriocins,\r\nand lytic enzymes. In recent years, detailed molecular analysis has led to a better understanding of\r\nthe underlying genetic mechanisms. New genomic and bioinformatic tools have permitted comparisons of\r\northologous genes between species, leading to predictions of the associated evolutionary mechanisms\r\nresponsible for diversification at the genetic and corresponding biochemical levels. The purpose of\r\nthis review is to describe the biodiversity of biosynthetic genes of plant-associated bacteria and\r\nfungi that encode selected examples of antimicrobial natural products. For each compound, the target\r\npathogen and biochemical mode of action are described, in order to draw attention to the complexity\r\nof these phenomena. We review recent information of the underlying molecular diversity and draw\r\nlessons through comparative genomic analysis of the orthologous coding sequences (CDS). We conclude\r\nby discussing emerging themes and gaps, discuss the metabolic pathways in the context of the\r\nphylogeny and ecology of their microbial hosts, and discuss potential evolutionary mechanisms that\r\nled to the diversification of biosynthetic gene clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing a Multi-Trait Approach to Manipulate Plant Functional Diversity in a Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function Experiment\r\n\r\nA frequent pattern emerging from biodiversity-ecosystem function studies is that functional group\r\nrichness enhances ecosystem functions such as primary productivity. However, the manipulation of\r\nfunctional group richness goes along with major disadvantages like the transformation of functional\r\ntrait data into categories or the exclusion of functional differences between organisms in the same\r\ngroup. In a mesocosm study we manipulated plant functional diversity based on the multi-trait\r\nFunctional Diversity (FD)-approach of Petchey and Gaston by using database data of seven functional\r\ntraits and information on the origin of the species in terms of being native or exotic. Along a\r\ngradient ranging from low to high FD we planted 40 randomly selected eight-species mixtures under\r\ncontrolled conditions. We found a significant positive linear correlation of FD with aboveground\r\nproductivity and a negative correlation with invasibility of the plant communities. Based on\r\ncommunity-weighted mean calculations for each functional trait, we figured out that the traits\r\nN-fixation and species origin, i.e. being native or exotic, played the most important role for\r\ncommunity productivity. Our results suggest that the identification of the impact of functional\r\ntrait diversity and the relative contributions of relevant traits is essential for a mechanistic\r\nunderstanding of the role of biodiversity for ecosystem functions such as aboveground biomass\r\nproduction and resistance against invasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelationship between Reproductive Allocation and Relative Abundance among 32 Species of a Tibetan Alpine Meadow: Effects of Fertilization and Grazing\r\n\r\nBackground Understanding the relationship between species traits and species abundance is an\r\nimportant goal in ecology and biodiversity science. Although theoretical studies predict that traits\r\nrelated to performance (e.g. reproductive allocation) are most directly linked to species abundance\r\nwithin a community, empirical investigations have rarely been done. It also remains unclear how\r\nenvironmental factors such as grazing or fertilizer application affect the predicted relationship.\r\nMethodology We conducted a 3-year field experiment in a Tibetan alpine meadow to assess the\r\nrelationship between plant reproductive allocation (RA) and species relative abundance (SRA) on\r\ncontrol, grazed and fertilized plots. Overall, the studied plant community contained 32 common\r\nspecies. Principal Findings At the treatment level, (i) RA was negatively correlated with SRA on\r\ncontrol plots and during the first year on fertilized plots. (ii) No negative RAâ€“SRA correlations\r\nwere observed on grazed plots and during the second and third year on fertilized plots. (iii) Seed\r\nsize was positively correlated with SRA on control plots. At the plot level, the correlation between\r\nSRA and RA were not affected by treatment, year or species composition. Conclusions/Significance Our\r\nstudy shows that the performance-related trait RA can negatively affect SRA within communities,\r\nwhich is possibly due to the tradeoffs between clonal growth (for space occupancy) and sexual\r\nreproduction. We propose that if different species occupy different positions along these tradeoffs\r\nit will contribute to biodiversity maintenance in local communities or even at lager scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nResource limitation, tolerance, and the future of ecological plant classification\r\n\r\nThroughout the evolutionary history of plants, drought, shade, and scarcity of nutrients have\r\nstructured ecosystems and communities globally. Humans have begun to drastically alter the\r\nprevalence of these environmental factors with untold consequences for plant communities and\r\necosystems worldwide. Given limitations in using organ-level traits to predict ecological\r\nperformance of species, recent advances using tolerances of low resource availability as plant\r\nfunctional traits are revealing the often hidden roles these factors have in structuring communities\r\nand are becoming central to classifying plants ecologically. For example, measuring the\r\nphysiological drought tolerance of plants has increased the predictability of differences among\r\nspecies in their ability to survive drought as well as the distribution of species within and among\r\necosystems. Quantifying the shade tolerance of species has improved our understanding of local and\r\nregional species diversity and how species have sorted within and among regions. As the stresses on\r\necosystems continue to shift, coordinated studies of whole-plant growth centered on tolerance of low\r\nresource availability will be central in predicting future ecosystem functioning and biodiversity.\r\nThis will require efforts that quantify tolerances for large numbers of species and develop\r\nbioinformatic and other techniques for comparing large number of species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiodiversity and Ecosystem Multi-Functionality: Observed Relationships in Smallholder Fallows in Western Kenya\r\n\r\nRecent studies indicate that species richness can enhance the ability of plant assemblages to\r\nsupport multiple ecosystem functions. To understand how and when ecosystem services depend on\r\nbiodiversity, it is valuable to expand beyond experimental grasslands. We examined whether plant\r\ndiversity improves the capacity of agroecosystems to sustain multiple ecosystem servicesâ€”production\r\nof wood and forage, and two elements of soil formationâ€”in two types of smallholder fallows in\r\nwestern Kenya. In 18 grazed and 21 improved fallows, we estimated biomass and quantified soil\r\norganic carbon, soil base cations, sand content, and soil infiltration capacity. For four ecosystem\r\nfunctions (wood biomass, forage biomass, soil base cations, steady infiltration rates) linked to the\r\nfocal ecosystem services, we quantified ecosystem service multi-functionality as (1) the proportion\r\nof functions above half-maximum, and (2) mean percentage excess above mean function values, and\r\nassessed whether plant diversity or environmental favorability better predicted multi-functionality.\r\nIn grazed fallows, positive effects of plant diversity best explained the proportion above half-\r\nmaximum and mean percentage excess, the former also declining with grazing intensity. In improved\r\nfallows, the proportion above half-maximum was not associated with soil carbon or plant diversity,\r\nwhile soil carbon predicted mean percentage excess better than diversity. Grazed fallows yielded\r\nstronger evidence for diversity effects on multi-functionality, while environmental conditions\r\nappeared more influential in improved fallows. The contrast in diversity-multi-functionality\r\nrelationships among fallow types appears related to differences in management and associated factors\r\nincluding disturbance and species composition. Complementary effects of species with contrasting\r\nfunctional traits on different functions and multi-functional species may have contributed to\r\ndiversity effects in grazed fallows.

Is Not Loss: Plant Biodiversity in the Anthropocene\r\n\r\nAnthropogenic global changes in biodiversity are generally portrayed in terms of massive native\r\nspecies losses or invasions caused by recent human disturbance. Yet these biodiversity changes and\r\nothers caused directly by human populations and their use of land tend to co-occur as long-term\r\nbiodiversity change processes in the Anthropocene. Here we explore contemporary anthropogenic global\r\npatterns in vascular plant species richness at regional landscape scales by combining spatially\r\nexplicit models and estimates for native species loss together with gains in exotics caused by\r\nspecies invasions and the introduction of agricultural domesticates and ornamental exotic plants.\r\nThe patterns thus derived confirm that while native losses are likely significant across at least\r\nhalf of Earth's ice-free land, model predictions indicate that plant species richness has increased\r\noverall in most regional landscapes, mostly because species invasions tend to exceed native losses.\r\nWhile global observing systems and models that integrate anthropogenic species loss, introduction\r\nand invasion at regional landscape scales remain at an early stage of development, integrating\r\npredictions from existing models within a single assessment confirms their vast global extent and\r\nsignificance while revealing novel patterns and their potential drivers. Effective global\r\nstewardship of plant biodiversity in the Anthropocene will require integrated frameworks for\r\nobserving, modeling and forecasting the different forms of anthropogenic biodiversity change\r\nprocesses at regional landscape scales, towards conserving biodiversity within the novel plant\r\ncommunities created and sustained by human systems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiodiversity Effects on Plant Stoichiometry\r\n\r\nIn the course of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning debate, the issue of multifunctionality of\r\nspecies communities has recently become a major focus. Elemental stoichiometry is related to a\r\nvariety of processes reflecting multiple plant responses to the biotic and abiotic environment. It\r\ncan thus be expected that the diversity of a plant assemblage alters community level plant tissue\r\nchemistry. We explored elemental stoichiometry in aboveground plant tissue (ratios of carbon,\r\nnitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and its relationship to plant diversity in a 5-year study in a\r\nlarge grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment). Species richness and functional group\r\nrichness affected community stoichiometry, especially by increasing C:P and N:P ratios. The primacy\r\nof either species or functional group richness effects depended on the sequence of testing these\r\nterms, indicating that both aspects of richness were congruent and complementary to expected strong\r\neffects of legume presence and grass presence on plant chemical composition. Legumes and grasses had\r\nantagonistic effects on C:N (âˆ’27.7% in the presence of legumes, +32.7% in the presence of grasses).\r\nIn addition to diversity effects on mean ratios, higher species richness consistently decreased the\r\nvariance of chemical composition for all elemental ratios. The diversity effects on plant\r\nstoichiometry has several non-exclusive explanations: The reduction in variance can reflect a\r\nstatistical averaging effect of species with different chemical composition or a optimization of\r\nnutrient uptake at high diversity, leading to converging ratios at high diversity. The shifts in\r\nmean ratios potentially reflect higher allocation to stem tissue as plants grew taller at higher\r\nrichness. By showing a first link between plant diversity and stoichiometry in a multiyear\r\nexperiment, our results indicate that losing plant species from grassland ecosystems will lead to\r\nless reliable chemical composition of forage for herbivorous consumers and belowground litter input.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the importance of a leaf: the ethnobotany of sarma in Turkey and the Balkans\r\n\r\nBackground Sarma - cooked leaves rolled around a filling made from rice and/or minced meat, possibly\r\nvegetables and seasoning plants â€“ represents one of the most widespread feasting dishes of the\r\nMiddle Eastern and South-Eastern European cuisines. Although cabbage and grape vine sarma is well-\r\nknown worldwide, the use of alternative plant leaves remains largely unexplored. The aim of this\r\nresearch was to document all of the botanical taxa whose leaves are used for preparing sarma in the\r\nfolk cuisines of Turkey and the Balkans. Methods Field studies were conducted during broader\r\nethnobotanical surveys, as well as during ad-hoc investigations between the years 2011 and 2014 that\r\nincluded diverse rural communities in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania,\r\nMacedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Turkey. Primary ethnobotanical and folkloric literatures in each\r\ncountry were also considered. Results Eighty-seven botanical taxa, mainly wild, belonging to 50\r\ngenera and 27 families, were found to represent the bio-cultural heritage of sarma in Turkey and the\r\nBalkans. The greatest plant biodiversity in sarma was found in Turkey and, to less extent, in\r\nBulgaria and Romania. The most commonly used leaves for preparing sarma were those of cabbage (both\r\nfresh and lacto-fermented), grape vine, beet, dock, sorrel, horseradish, lime tree, bean, and\r\nspinach. In a few cases, the leaves of endemic species (Centaurea haradjianii, Rumex gracilescens,\r\nand R. olympicus in Turkey) were recorded. Other uncommon sarma preparations were based on lightly\r\ntoxic taxa, such as potato leaves in NE Albania, leaves of Arum, Convolvulus, and Smilax species in\r\nTurkey, of Phytolacca americana in Macedonia, and of Tussilago farfara in diverse countries.\r\nMoreover, the use of leaves of the introduced species Reynoutria japonica in Romania, Colocasia\r\nesculenta in Turkey, and Phytolacca americana in Macedonia shows the dynamic nature of folk\r\ncuisines. Conclusion The rich ethnobotanical diversity of sarma confirms the urgent need to record\r\nfolk culinary plant knowledge. The results presented here can be implemented into initiatives aimed\r\nat re-evaluating folk cuisines and niche food markets based on local neglected ingredients, and\r\npossibly also to foster trajectories of the avant-garde cuisines inspired by ethnobotanical\r\nknowledge.\r\n\rcountries\n\r\n\r\nReading the Complex Skipper Butterfly Fauna of One Tropical Place\r\n\r\nBackground An intense, 30-year, ongoing biodiversity inventory of Lepidoptera, together with their\r\nfood plants and parasitoids, is centered on the rearing of wild-caught caterpillars in the 120,000\r\nterrestrial hectares of dry, rain, and cloud forest of Area de Conservacion Guanacaste (ACG) in\r\nnorthwestern Costa Rica. Since 2003, DNA barcoding of all species has aided their identification and\r\ndiscovery. We summarize the process and results for a large set of the species of two speciose\r\nsubfamilies of ACG skipper butterflies (Hesperiidae) and emphasize the effectiveness of barcoding\r\nthese species (which are often difficult and time-consuming to identify). Methodology/Principal\r\nFindings Adults are DNA barcoded by the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario, Guelph, Canada; and they\r\nare identified by correlating the resulting COI barcode information with more traditional\r\ninformation such as food plant, facies, genitalia, microlocation within ACG, caterpillar traits,\r\netc. This process has found about 303 morphologically defined species of eudamine and pyrgine\r\nHesperiidae breeding in ACG (about 25% of the ACG butterfly fauna) and another 44 units indicated by\r\ndistinct barcodes (nâ€Š=â€Š9,094), which may be additional species and therefore may represent as much\r\nas a 13% increase. All but the members of one complex can be identified by their DNA barcodes.\r\nConclusions/Significance Addition of DNA barcoding to the methodology greatly improved the\r\ninventory, both through faster (hence cheaper) accurate identification of the species that are\r\ndistinguishable without barcoding, as well as those that require it, and through the revelation of\r\nspecies â€œhiddenâ€� within what have long been viewed as single species. Barcoding increased the\r\nrecognition of species-level specialization. It would be no more appropriate to ignore barcode data\r\nin a species inventory than it would be to ignore adult genitalia variation or caterpillar ecology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Evaluation of Two Hands-On Lab Styles for Plant Biodiversity in Undergraduate Biology\r\n\r\nTwo formats of plant biodiversity labs were evaluated: a learning cycle format and an expository\r\nformat. Each had a prelab, a hands-on lab, and a write-to-learn postlab. Bloom's lower- and higher-\r\norder cognition and attitudes were assessed. Results showed that the two styles had different costs\r\nand benefits. Evidence indicates that a blended style may be best. We compared learning cycle and\r\nexpository formats for teaching about plant biodiversity in an inquiry-oriented university biology\r\nlab class (n = 465). Both formats had preparatory lab activities, a hands-on lab, and a postlab with\r\nreflection and argumentation. Learning was assessed with a lab report, a practical quiz in lab, and\r\na multiple-choice exam in the concurrent lecture. Attitudes toward biology and treatments were also\r\nassessed. We used linear mixed-effect models to determine impacts of lab style on lower-order\r\ncognition (LO) and higher-order cognition (HO) based on Bloom's taxonomy. Relative to the expository\r\ntreatment, the learning cycle treatment had a positive effect on HO and a negative effect on LO\r\nincluded in lab reports; a positive effect on transfer of LO from the lab report to the quiz;\r\nnegative impacts on LO quiz performance and on attitudes toward the lab; and a higher degree of\r\nperceived difficulty.

is the UK's pollinator biodiversity? The importance of urban areas for flower-visiting insects\r\n\r\nInsect pollinators provide a crucial ecosystem service, but are under threat. Urban areas could be\r\nimportant for pollinators, though their value relative to other habitats is poorly known. We\r\ncompared pollinator communities using quantified flower-visitation networks in 36 sites (each 1 km2)\r\nin three landscapes: urban, farmland and nature reserves. Overall, flower-visitor abundance and\r\nspecies richness did not differ significantly between the three landscape types. Bee abundance did\r\nnot differ between landscapes, but bee species richness was higher in urban areas than farmland.\r\nHoverfly abundance was higher in farmland and nature reserves than urban sites, but species richness\r\ndid not differ significasitesntly. While urban pollinator assemblages were more homogeneous across space\r\nthan those in farmland or nature reserves, there was no significant difference in the numbers of\r\nrarer species between the three landscapes. Network-level specialization was higher in farmland than\r\nurban sites. Relative to other habitats, urban visitors foraged from a greater number of plant\r\nspecies (higher generality) but also visited a lower proportion of available plant species (higher\r\nspecialization), both possibly driven by higher urban plant richness. Urban areas are growing, and\r\nimproving their value for pollinators should be part of any national strategy to conserve and\r\nrestore pollinators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiversification and coevolution in brood pollination mutualisms: Windows into the role of biotic interactions in generating biological diversity.\r\n\r\nBrood pollination mutualisms-interactions in which specialized insects are both the pollinators (as\r\nadults) and seed predators (as larvae) of their host plants-have been influential study systems for\r\ncoevolutionary biology. These mutualisms include those between figs and fig wasps, yuccas and yucca\r\nmoths, leafflowers and leafflower moths, globeflowers and globeflower flies, Silene plants and\r\nHadena and Perizoma moths, saxifrages and Greya moths, and senita cacti and senita moths. The high\r\nreciprocal diversity and species-specificity of some of these mutualisms have been cited as evidence\r\nthat coevolution between plants and pollinators drives their mutual diversification. However, the\r\nmechanisms by which these mutualisms diversify have received less attention. In this paper, we\r\nreview key hypotheses about how these mutualisms diversify and what role coevolution between plants\r\nand pollinators may play in this process. We find that most species-rich brood pollination\r\nmutualisms show significant phylogenetic congruence at high taxonomic scales, but there is limited\r\nevidence for the processes of both cospeciation and duplication, and there are no unambiguous\r\nexamples known of strict-sense contemporaneous cospeciation. Allopatric speciation appears important\r\nacross multiple systems, particularly in the insects. Host-shifts appear to be common, and\r\nwidespread host-shifts by pollinators may displace other pollinator lineages. There is relatively\r\nlittle evidence for a \"coevolution through cospeciation\" model or that coevolution promotes\r\nspeciation in these systems. Although we have made great progress in understanding the mechanisms by\r\nwhich brood pollination mutualisms diversify, many opportunities remain to use these intriguing\r\nsymbioses to understand the role of biotic interactions in generating biological diversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDemonstration of pollinator-mediated competition between two native Impatiens species, Impatiens noli-tangere and I.Â textori (Balsaminaceae)\r\n\r\nPlantâ€“plant interspecific competition via pollinators occurs when the flowering seasons of two or\r\nmore plant species overlap and the pollinator fauna is shared. Negative sexual interactions between\r\nspecies (reproductive interference) through improper heterospecific pollen transfer have recently\r\nbeen reported between native and invasive species demonstrating pollination-driven competition. We\r\nfocused on two native Impatiens species (I.Â noli-tangere and I.Â textori) found in Japan and examined\r\nwhether pollinator-mediated plant competition occurs between them. We demonstrate that I.Â noli-\r\ntangere and I.Â textori share the same pollination niche (i.e., flowering season, pollinator fauna,\r\nand position of pollen on the pollinator's body). In addition, heterospecific pollen grains were\r\ndeposited on most stigmas of both I.Â noli-tangere and I.Â textori flowers that were situated within\r\n2Â m of flowers of the other species resulting in depressed fruit set. Further, by hand-pollination\r\nexperiments, we show that when as few as 10% of the pollen grains are heterospecific, fruit set is\r\ndecreased to less than half in both species. These results show that intensive pollinator-mediated\r\ncompetition occurs between I.Â noli-tangere and I.Â textori. This study suggests that intensive\r\npollinator-mediated competition occurs in the wild even when interacting species are both native and\r\nnot invasive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPollination ecology and the possible impacts of environmental change in the Southwest Australian Biodiversity Hotspot.\r\n\r\nThe Southwest Australian Biodiversity Hotspot contains an exceptionally diverse flora on an ancient,\r\nlow-relief but edaphically diverse landscape. Since European colonization, the primary threat to the\r\nflora has been habitat clearance, though climate change is an impending threat. Here, we review (i)\r\nthe ecology of nectarivores and biotic pollination systems in the region, (ii) the evidence that\r\ntrends in pollination strategies are a consequence of characteristics of the landscape, and (iii)\r\nbased on these discussions, provide predictions to be tested on the impacts of environmental change\r\non pollination systems. The flora of southwestern Australia has an exceptionally high level of\r\nvertebrate pollination, providing the advantage of highly mobile, generalist pollinators.\r\nNectarivorous invertebrates are primarily generalibioticst foragers, though an increasing number of\r\ncolletid bees are being recognized as being specialized at the level of plant family or more rarely\r\ngenus. While generalist pollination strategies dominate among insect-pollinated plants, there are\r\nsome cases of extreme specialization, most notably the multiple evolutions of sexual deception in\r\nthe Orchidaceae. Preliminary data suggest that bird pollination confers an advantage of greater\r\npollen movement and may represent a mechanism for minimizing inbreeding in naturally fragmented\r\npopulations. The effects of future environmental change are predicted to result from a combination\r\nof the resilience of pollination guilds and changes in their foraging and dispersal behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInsect pollination and self-incompatibility in edible and/or medicinal crops in southwestern China, a global hotspot of biodiversity.\r\n\r\nAn increasing global demand for food, coupled with the widespread decline of pollinator diversity,\r\nremains an international concern in agriculture and genetic conservation. In particular, there are\r\nlarge gaps in the study of the pollination of economically important and traditionally grown species\r\nin China. Many plant species grown in China are both edible and used medicinally. The country\r\nretains extensive written records of agricultural and apicultural practices, facilitating\r\ncontemporary studies of some important taxa. Here, we focus on Yunnan in southwestern China, a mega-\r\nbiodiversity hotspot for medicinal/food plants. We used plant and insect taxa as model systems to\r\nunderstand the patterns and consequences of pollinator deficit to crops. We identified several gaps\r\nand limitations in research on the pollination ecology and breeding systems of domesticated taxa and\r\ntheir wild relatives in Yunnan and asked the following questions: (1) What is known about\r\npollination systems of edible and medicinal plants in Yunnan? (2) What are the most important\r\npollinators of Codonopsis subglobosa (Campanulaceae)? (3) How important are native pollinator\r\nspecies for maximizing yield in Chinese crops compared with the introduced Apis mellifera? We found\r\nthat some crops that require cross-pollination now depend exclusively on hand pollination. Three\r\ndomesticated crops are dependent primarily on the native but semidomesticated Apis cerana and the\r\nintroduced A. mellifera. Other species of wild pollinators often play important roles for certain\r\nspecialty crops (e.g., Vespa velutina pollinates Codonopsis subglobosa).

enhances ecosystem multifunctionality across trophic levels and habitats\r\n\r\nThe importance of biodiversity for the integrated functioning of ecosystems remains unclear because\r\nmost evidence comes from analyses of biodiversity's effect on individual functions. Here we show\r\nthat the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem function become more important as more functions are\r\nconsidered. We present the first systematic investigation of biodiversity's effect on ecosystem\r\nmultifunctionality across multiple taxa, trophic levels and habitats using a comprehensive database\r\nof 94 manipulations of species richness. We show that species-rich communities maintained multiple\r\nfunctions at higher levels than depauperate ones. These effects were stronger for herbivore\r\nbiodiversity than for plant biodiversity, and were remarkably consistent across aquatic and\r\nterrestrial habitats. Despite observed tradeoffs, the overall effect of biodiversity on\r\nmultifunctionality grew stronger as more functions were considered. These results indicate that\r\nprior research has underestimated the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem functioning by\r\nfocusing on individual functions and taxonomic groups.  The influence of biodiversity on multiple\r\necosystem processes is not well understood. Analysing 94 biodiversity-ecosystem functioning\r\nexperiments, Lefcheck et al. find that increased species richness maintains more ecological\r\nfunctions, across multiple taxa, trophic levels and habitats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuantifying Preferences for the Natural World Using Monetary and Nonmonetary Assessments of Value\r\n\r\nGiven that funds for biodiversity conservation are limited, there is a need to understand peopleâ€™s\r\npreferences for its different components. To date, such preferences have largely been measured in\r\nmonetary terms. However, how people value biodiversity may differ from economic theory, and there is\r\nlittle consensus over whether monetary metrics are always appropriate or the degree to which other\r\nmethods offer alternative and complementary perspectives on value. We used a choice experiment to\r\ncompare monetary amounts recreational visitors to urban green spaces were willing to pay for\r\nbiodiversity enhancement (increases in species richness for birds, plants, and aquatic\r\nmacroinvertebrates) with self-reported psychological gains in well-being derived from visiting the\r\nsame sites. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) estimates were significant and positive, and respondents\r\nreported high gains in well-being across 3 axes derived from environmental psychology theories\r\n(reflection, attachment, continuity with past). The 2 metrics were broadly congruent. Participants\r\nwith above-median self-reported well-being scores were willing to pay significantly higher amounts\r\nfor enhancing species richness than those with below-median scores, regardless of taxon. The socio-\r\neconomic and demographic background of participants played little role in determining either their\r\nwell-being or the probability of choosing a paying option within the choice experiment. Site-level\r\nenvironmental characteristics were only somewhat related to WTP, but showed strong associations with\r\nself-reported well-being. Both approaches are likely to reflect a combination of the environmental\r\nproperties of a site and unobserved individual preference heterogeneity for the natural world. Our\r\nresults suggest that either metric will deliver mutually consistent results in an assessment of\r\nenvironmental preferences, although which approach is preferable depends on why one wishes to\r\nmeasure values for the natural world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent and Future Patterns of Global Marine Mammal Biodiversity\r\n\r\nQuantifying the spatial distribution of taxa is an important prerequisite for the preservation of\r\nbiodiversity, and can provide a baseline against which to measure the impacts of climate change.\r\nHere we analyse patterns of marine mammal species richness based on predictions of global\r\ndistributional ranges for 115 species, including all extant pinnipeds and cetaceans. We used an\r\nenvironmental suitability model specifically designed to address the paucity of distributional data\r\nfor many marine mammal species. We generated richness patterns by overlaying predicted distributions\r\nfor all species; these were then validated against sightings data from dedicated long-term surveys\r\nin the Eastern Tropical Pacific, the Northeast Atlantic and the Southern Ocean. Model outputs\r\ncorrelated well with empirically observed patterns of biodiversity in all three survey regions.\r\nMarine mammal richness was predicted to be highest in temperate waters of both hemispheres with\r\ndistinct hotspots around New Zealand, Japan, Baja California, the Galapagos Islands, the Southeast\r\nPacific, and the Southern Ocean. We then applied our model to explore potential changes in\r\nbiodiversity under future perturbations of environmental conditions. Forward projections of\r\nbiodiversity using an intermediate Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) temperature\r\nscenario predicted that projected ocean warming and changes in sea ice cover until 2050 may have\r\nmoderate effects on the spatial patterns of marine mammal richness. Increases in cetacean richness\r\nwere predicted above 40Â° latitude in both hemispheres, while decreases in both pinniped and cetacean\r\nrichness were expected at lower latitudes. Our results show how species distribution models can be\r\napplied to explore broad patterns of marine biodiversity worldwide for taxa for which limited\r\ndistributional data are available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison of microbial populations in the small intestine, large intestine and feces of healthy horses using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism\r\n\r\nBackground The composition of the microbiota of the equine intestinal tract is complex. Determining\r\nwhether the microbial composition of fecal samples is representative of proximal compartments of the\r\ndigestive tract could greatly simplify future studies. The objectives of this study were to compare\r\nthe microbial populations of the duodenum, ileum, cecum, colon and rectum (feces) within and between\r\nhealthy horses, and to determine whether rectal (fecal) samples are representative of proximal\r\nsegments of the gastrointestinal tract. Intestinal samples were collected from ten euthanized\r\nhorses. 16S rRNA gene PCR-based TRFLP was used to investigate microbiota richness in various\r\nsegments of the gastrointestinal tract, and dice similarity indices were calculated to compare the\r\nsamples. Results Within horses large variations of microbial populations along the gastrointestinal\r\ntract were seen. The microbiota in rectal samples was only partially representative of other\r\nintestinal compartments. The highest similarity was obtained when feces were compared to the cecum.\r\nLarge compartmental variations were also seen when microbial populations were compared between six\r\nhorses with similar dietary and housing management. Conclusion Rectal samples were not entirely\r\nrepresentative of intestinal compartments in the small or large intestine. This should be taken into\r\naccount when designing studies using fecal sampling to assess other intestinal compartments.\r\nSimilarity between horses with similar dietary and husbandry management was also limited, suggesting\r\nthat parts of the intestinal microbiota were unique to each animal in this study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComparative molecular analysis of chemolithoautotrophic bacterial diversity and community structure from coastal saline soils, Gujarat, India\r\n\r\nBackground Soils harbour high diversity of obligate as well as facultative chemolithoautotrophic\r\nbacteria that contribute significantly to CO2 dynamics in soil. In this study, we used culture\r\ndependent and independent methods to assess the community structure and diversity of\r\nchemolithoautotrophs in agricultural and coastal barren saline soils (low and high salinity). We\r\nstudied the composition and distribution of chemolithoautotrophs by means of functional marker gene\r\ncbbL encoding large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and a phylogenetic\r\nmarker 16S rRNA gene. The cbbL form IA and IC genes associated with carbon fixation were analyzed to\r\ngain insight into metabolic potential of chemolithoautotrophs in three soil types of coastal\r\necosystems which had a very different salt load and sulphur content. Results In cbbL libraries, the\r\ncbbL form IA was retrieved only from high saline soil whereas form IC was found in all three soil\r\ntypes. The form IC cbbL was also amplified from bacterial isolates obtained from all soil types. A\r\nnumber of novel monophyletic lineages affiliated with form IA and IC phylogenetic trees were found.\r\nThese were distantly related to the known cbbL sequences from agroecosystem, volcanic ashes and\r\nmarine environments. In 16S rRNA clone libraries, the agricultural soil was dominated by\r\nchemolithoautotrophs (Betaproteobacteria) whereas photoautotrophic Chloroflexi and sulphide\r\noxidizers dominated saline ecosystems. Environmental specificity was apparently visible at both\r\nhigher taxonomic levels (phylum) and lower taxonomic levels (genus and species). The differentiation\r\nin community structure and diversity in three soil ecosystems was supported by LIBSHUFF (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.001)\r\nand UniFrac. Conclusion This study may provide fundamentally new insights into the role of\r\nchemolithoautotrophic and photoautotrophic bacterial diversity in biochemical carbon cycling in\r\nbarren saline soils. The bacterial communities varied greatly among the three sites, probably\r\nbecause of differences in salinity, carbon and sulphur contents. The cbbL form IA-containing\r\nsulphide-oxidizing chemolithotrophs were found only in high saline soil clone library, thus giving\r\nthe indication of sulphide availability in this soil ecosystem.

Metabolism by Human Gut Microbiota upon in Vitro Digestion of Contaminated Soils\r\n\r\nBackground Speciation analysis is essential when evaluating risks from arsenic (As) exposure. In an\r\noral exposure scenario, the importance of presystemic metabolism by gut microorganisms has been\r\nevidenced with in vivo animal models and in vitro experiments with animal microbiota. However, it is\r\nunclear whether human microbiota display similar As metabolism, especially when present in a\r\ncontaminated matrix. Objectives We evaluated the metabolic potency of in vitro cultured human colon\r\nmicrobiota toward inorganic As (iAs) and As-contaminated soils. Methods A colon microbial community\r\nwas cultured in a dynamic model of the human gut. These colon microbiota were incubated with iAs and\r\nwith As-contaminated urban soils. We determined As speciation analysis using high-performance liquid\r\nchromatography coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results We found a high\r\ndegree of methylation for colon digests both of iAs (10 Î¼g methylarsenical/g biomass/hr) and of As-\r\ncontaminated soils (up to 28 Î¼g/g biomass/hr). Besides the formation of monomethylarsonic acid\r\n(MMAV), we detected the highly toxic monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII). Moreover, this is the first\r\ndescription of microbial thiolation leading to monomethylmonothioarsonic acid (MMMTAV). MMMTAV, the\r\ntoxicokinetic properties of which are not well known, was in many cases a major metabolite.\r\nConclusions Presystemic As metabolism is a significant process in the human body. Toxicokinetic\r\nstudies aiming to completely elucidate the As metabolic pathway would therefore benefit from\r\nincorporating the metabolic potency of human gut microbiota. This will result in more accurate risk\r\ncharacterization associated with As exposures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiming impacts on soils, crops and biodiversity in the UK: A review.\r\n\r\nFertile soil is fundamental to our ability to achieve food security, but problems with soil\r\ndegradation (such as acidification) are exacerbated by poor management. Consequently, there is a\r\nneed to better understand management approaches that deliver multiple ecosystem services from\r\nagricultural land. There is global interest in sustainable soil management including the re-\r\nevaluation of existing management practices. Liming is a long established practice to ameliorate\r\nacidic soils and many liming-induced changes are well understood. For instance, short-term liming\r\nimpacts are detected on soil biota and in soil biological processes (such as in N cycling where\r\nliming can increase N availability for plant uptake). The impacts of liming on soil carbon storage\r\nare variable and strongly relate to soil type, land use, climate and multiple management factors.\r\nLiming influences all elements in soils and as such there are numerous simultaneous changes to soil\r\nprocesses which in turn affect the plant nutrient uptake; two examples of positive impact for crops\r\nare increased P availability and decreased uptake of toxic heavy metals. Soil physical conditions\r\nare at least maintained or improved by liming, but the time taken to detect change varies\r\nsignificantly. Arable crops differ in their sensitivity to soil pH and for most crops there is a\r\npositive yield response. Liming also introduces implications for the development of different crop\r\ndiseases and liming management is adjusted according to crop type within a given rotation. Repeated\r\nlime applications tend to improve grassland biomass production, although grassland response is\r\nvariable and indirect as it relates to changes in nutrient availability. Other indicators of liming\r\nresponse in grassland are detected in mineral content and herbage quality which have implications\r\nfor livestock-based production systems. Ecological studies have shown positive impacts of liming on\r\nbiodiversity; such as increased earthworm abundance that provides habitat for wading birds in upland\r\ngrasslands. Finally, understanding of liming impacts on soil and crop processes are explored\r\ntogether with functional aspects (in terms of ecosystems services) in a new qualitative framework\r\nthat includes consideration of how liming impacts change with time. This holistic approach provides\r\ninsights into the far-reaching impacts that liming has on ecosystems and the potential for liming to\r\nenhance the multiple benefits from agriculturally managed land. Recommendations are given for future\r\nresearch on the impact of liming and the implications for ecosystem services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrobiota Characterization of Compost Using Omics Approaches Opens New Perspectives for Phytophthora Root Rot Control.\r\n\r\nPhytophthora root rot caused by Phytophthora nicotianae is an economically important disease in\r\npepper crops. The use of suppressive composts is a low environmental impact method for its control.\r\nAlthough attempts have been made to reveal the relationship between microbiota and compost\r\nsuppressiveness, little is known about the microorganisms associated with disease suppression. Here,\r\nan Ion Torrent platform was used to assess the microbial composition of composts made of different\r\nagro-industrial waste and with different levels of suppressiveness against P. nicotianae. Both\r\nbacterial and fungal populations responded differently depending on the chemical heterogeneity of\r\nmaterials used during the composting process. High proportions (67-75%) of vineyard pruning waste\r\nwere used in the most suppressive composts, COM-A and COM-B. This material may have promoted the\r\npresence of higher relative abundance of Ascomycota as well as higher microbial activity, which have\r\nproved to be essential for controlling the disease. Although no unique fungi or bacteria have been\r\ndetected in neither suppressive nor conducive composts, relatively high abundance of Fusarium and\r\nZopfiella were found in compost COM-B and COM-A, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is\r\nthe first work that studies compost metabolome. Surprisingly, composts and peat clustered together\r\nin principal component analysis of the metabolic data according to their levels of suppressiveness\r\nachieved. This study demonstrated the need for combining the information provided by different\r\ntechniques, including metagenomics and metametabolomics, to better understand the ability of compost\r\nto control plant diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Relationships between Abiotic Soil Properties and Soil Biota across Spatial Scales and Different Land-Use Types\r\n\r\nVery few principles have been unraveled that explain the relationship between soil properties and\r\nsoil biota across large spatial scales and different land-use types. Here, we seek these general\r\nrelationships using data from 52 differently managed grassland and forest soils in three study\r\nregions spanning a latitudinal gradient in Germany. We hypothesize that, after extraction of\r\nvariation that is explained by location and land-use type, soil properties still explain significant\r\nproportions of variation in the abundance and diversity of soil biota. If the relationships between\r\npredictors and soil organisms were analyzed individually for each predictor group, soil properties\r\nexplained the highest amount of variation in soil biota abundance and diversity, followed by land-\r\nuse type and sampling location. After extraction of variation that originated from location or land-\r\nuse, abiotic soil properties explained significant amounts of variation in fungal, meso- and\r\nmacrofauna, but not in yeast or bacterial biomass or diversity. Nitrate or nitrogen concentration\r\nand fungal biomass were positively related, but nitrate concentration was negatively related to the\r\nabundances of Collembola and mites and to the myriapod species richness across a range of forest and\r\ngrassland soils. The species richness of earthworms was positively correlated with clay content of\r\nsoils independent of sample location and land-use type. Our study indicates that after accounting\r\nfor heterogeneity resulting from large scale differences among sampling locations and land-use\r\ntypes, soil properties still explain significant proportions of variation in fungal and soil fauna\r\nabundance or diversity. However, soil biota was also related to processes that act at larger spatial\r\nscales and bacteria or soil yeasts only showed weak relationships to soil properties. We therefore\r\nargue that more general relationships between soil properties and soil biota can only be derived\r\nfrom future studies that consider larger spatial scales and different land-use types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Biodegradation of tri- and perchloroethylene in sewage waters and soils by a microbial consortium of compost and phototrophic bacteria].\r\n\r\nCompost and phototrophic bacteria are found to be able to degrade trichloroethylene (TCE) and\r\nperchloroethylene (PCE).

Species and Biodiversity Crises: Testing the Link in the Late Devonian\r\n\r\nDuring the Late Devonian Biodiversity Crisis, the primary driver of biodiversity decline was the\r\ndramatic reduction in speciation rates, not elevated extinction rates; however, the causes of\r\nspeciation decline have been previously unstudied. Speciation, the formation of new species from\r\nancestral populations, occurs by two primary allopatric mechanisms: vicariance, where the ancestral\r\npopulation is passively divided into two large subpopulations that later diverge and form two\r\ndaughter species, and dispersal, in which a small subset of the ancestral population actively\r\nmigrates then diverges to form a new species. Studies of modern and fossil clades typically document\r\nspeciation by vicariance in much higher frequencies than speciation by dispersal. To assess the\r\nmechanism behind Late Devonian speciation reduction, speciation rates were calculated within\r\nstratigraphically constrained species-level phylogenetic hypotheses for three representative clades\r\nand mode of speciation at cladogenetic events was assessed across four clades in three phyla:\r\nArthropoda, Brachiopoda, and Mollusca. In all cases, Devonian taxa exhibited a congruent reduction\r\nin speciation rate between the Middle Devonian pre-crisis interval and the Late Devonian crisis\r\ninterval. Furthermore, speciation via vicariance is almost entirely absent during the crisis\r\ninterval; most episodes of speciation during this time were due to dispersal. The shutdown of\r\nspeciation by vicariance during this interval was related to widespread interbasinal species\r\ninvasions. The lack of Late Devonian vicariance is diametrically opposed to the pattern observed in\r\nother geologic intervals, which suggests the loss of vicariant speciation attributable to species\r\ninvasions during the Late Devonian was a causal factor in the biodiversity crisis. Similarly, modern\r\necosystems, in which invasive species are rampant, may be expected to exhibit similar shutdown of\r\nspeciation by vicariance as an outcome of the modern biodiversity crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies richness and macronutrient content of wawo worms (Polychaeta, Annelida) from Ambonese waters, Maluku, Indonesia\r\n\r\nThe aims of this research were to: (1) investigate the species richness of wawo worms, and to (2)\r\nanalyze macronutrient content of the worms. Wawo worms were sampled using a fishing net on March\r\n18th-19th, 2014, from Ambonese waters, Maluku. As many as 26 wawo species belonging to 5 families\r\nwere identified. Palola sp. was identified as the most abundant species of wawo, followed by\r\nLysidice oele, Horst 1905, Eunice spp. and nereidids. Results of the proximate analysis reveal that\r\nfemale epitokes of Palola sp. contain 10.78 % ash, 10.71 % moisture, 11.67 % crude fat, 54.72 %\r\ncrude protein and 12.12 % carbohydrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaximizing species conservation in continental Ecuador: a case of systematic conservation planning for biodiverse regions\r\n\r\nEcuador has the largest number of species by area worldwide, but also a low representation of\r\nspecies within its protected areas. Here, we applied systematic conservation planning to identify\r\npotential areas for conservation in continental Ecuador, with the aim of increasing the\r\nrepresentation of terrestrial species diversity in the protected area network. We selected 809\r\nterrestrial species (amphibians, birds, mammals, and plants), for which distributions were estimated\r\nvia species distribution models (SDMs), using Maxent. For each species we established conservation\r\ngoals based on conservation priorities, and estimated new potential protected areas using Marxan\r\nconservation planning software. For each selected area, we determined their conservation priority\r\nand feasibility of establishment, two important aspects in the decision-making processes. We found\r\nthat according to our conservation goals, the current protected area network contains large\r\nconservation gaps. Potential areas for conservation almost double the surface area of currently\r\nprotected areas. Most of the newly proposed areas are located in the Coast, a region with large\r\nconservation gaps and irreversible changes in land use. The most feasible areas for conservation\r\nwere found in the Amazon and Andes regions, which encompass more undisturbed habitats, and already\r\nharbor most of the current reserves. Our study allows defining a viable strategy for preserving\r\nEcuador's biodiversity, by combining SDMs, GIS-based decision-support software, and priority and\r\nfeasibility assessments of the selected areas. This approach is useful for complementing protected\r\narea networks in countries with great biodiversity, insufficient biological information, and limited\r\nresources for conservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiodiversity loss decreases parasite diversity: theory and patterns\r\n\r\nPast models have suggested hostâ€“parasite coextinction could lead to linear, or concave down\r\nrelationships between free-living species richness and parasite richness. I explored several models\r\nfor the relationship between parasite richness and biodiversity loss. Life cycle complexity, low\r\ngenerality of parasites and sensitivity of hosts reduced the robustness of parasite species to the\r\nloss of free-living species diversity. Food-web complexity and the ordering of extinctions altered\r\nthese relationships in unpredictable ways. Each disassembly of a food web resulted in a unique\r\nrelationship between parasite richness and the richness of free-living species, because the\r\nextinction trajectory of parasites was sensitive to the order of extinctions of free-living species.\r\nHowever, the average of many disassemblies tended to approximate an analytical model. Parasites of\r\nspecialist hosts and hosts higher on food chains were more likely to go extinct in food-web models.\r\nFurthermore, correlated extinctions between hosts and parasites (e.g. if parasites share a host with\r\na specialist predator) led to steeper declines in parasite richness with biodiversity loss. In\r\nempirical food webs with random removals of free-living species, the relationship between free-\r\nliving species richness and parasite richness was, on average, quasi-linear, suggesting biodiversity\r\nloss reduces parasite diversity more than previously thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFatal attraction: rare species in the spotlight\r\n\r\nThe exploitation of rare and endangered species can end in the species's extinction because the\r\nincreased value people associate with rarity increases the economic incentive to exploit the last\r\nindividuals, creating a positive feedback loop. This recently proposed concept, called the\r\nanthropogenic Allee effect (AAE), relies on the assumption that people do value rarity, but this\r\nremains to be established. Moreover, it also remains to be determined whether attraction to rarity\r\nis a trait confined to a minority of hobbyists (e.g. wildlife collectors, exotic pet owners) or\r\ncharacteristic of the general public. We estimated how much the general public valued rare species\r\ncompared with common ones, using five different metrics related to personal investment: time spent,\r\nphysical effort, unpleasantness, economic investment and risk. We surveyed the visitors of a zoo. To\r\nsee the rare species, the visitors to the zoo invested more time in searching and contemplation,\r\nthey were ready to expend more physical effort, they tolerated more unpleasant conditions, they were\r\nwilling to pay more and, finally, they risked more to obtain (steal) a rare species. Our results\r\nprovide substantial evidence of how the general public places more value on rare species, compared\r\nwith common species. This confirms the AAE as an actual process, which in addition concerns a large\r\npart of the population. This has important consequences for the conservation of species that are\r\nrare now, or that could become so in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","entities":{"Thing":[{"indices":[9,16]},{"indices":[21,33]},{"indices":[108,120],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[151,163],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[203,213]},{"indices":[214,218]},{"indices":[234,244],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[234,244],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[234,244],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[245,249],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[276,286],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[327,337],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[360,367],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[579,586],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[620,626]},{"indices":[620,626]},{"indices":[668,672],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[702,709],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[733,739]},{"indices":[733,739]},{"indices":[767,777],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[824,834],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[895,905],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[917,927],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[928,932],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[988,995],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1071,1081],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1183,1191]},{"indices":[1257,1267],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1268,1272],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1374,1384],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1419,1425]},{"indices":[1472,1482],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1540,1550],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1625,1632],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1798,1808],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1825,1832],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1896,1908],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1966,1973],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2035,2045]},{"indices":[2035,2045],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2088,2100],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2116,2123],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2116,2132]},{"indices":[2116,2132]},{"indices":[2137,2150]},{"indices":[2294,2301],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2294,2310],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2346,2359],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2502,2509],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2599,2606],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2730,2736]},{"indices":[2833,2840]},{"indices":[2853,2865]},{"indices":[2861,2865],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2883,2890],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2883,2903],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2891,2903],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2949,2961],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3031,3038],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3042,3046]},{"indices":[3092,3099],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3111,3125],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3156,3168],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3211,3223],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3310,3317],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3335,3349],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3335,3349],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3345,3349],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3388,3395],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3429,3435],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3482,3489],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3541,3548],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3564,3576],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3593,3605],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3646,3660],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3676,3688],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3726,3730],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3752,3764],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3897,3909],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3929,3943],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3929,3943],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3939,3943],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3968,3980],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4007,4019],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4046,4050],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4065,4079],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4119,4130],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4134,4139],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4162,4174],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4246,4258],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4337,4344],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4434,4438],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4467,4479],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4655,4659],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4693,4705],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4771,4783],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4792,4804],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4908,4918],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4992,4999],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4992,5008],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5110,5122],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5241,5248],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5277,5284],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5296,5300],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5336,5346],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5422,5426],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5524,5531],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5546,5556],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5546,5556],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5546,5556],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5611,5621],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5638,5645],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5785,5789],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5831,5835],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5873,5883],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6024,6036],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6057,6061],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6103,6110],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6151,6158],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6151,6167],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6232,6244],"safe.regex":"true"},{"i

Given the seriousness of this\r\nissue, there is a need to effectively monitor global biodiversity. Because performing biodiversity\r\ncensuses of all taxonomic groups is prohibitively costly, indicator groups have been studied to\r\nestimate the biodiversity of different taxonomic groups. Quantifying cross-taxon congruence is a\r\nmethod of evaluating the assumption that the diversity of one taxonomic group can be used to predict\r\nthe diversity of another. To improve the predictive ability of cross-taxon congruence in aquatic\r\necosystems, we evaluated whether body size, measured as the ratio of average body length between\r\norganismal groups, is a significant predictor of their cross-taxon biodiversity congruence. To test\r\nthis hypothesis, we searched the published literature and screened for studies that used species\r\nrichness correlations as their metric of cross-taxon congruence. We extracted 96 correlation\r\ncoefficients from 16 studies, which encompassed 784 inland water bodies. With these correlation\r\ncoefficients, we conducted a categorical meta-analysis, grouping data based on the body size ratio\r\nof organisms. Our results showed that cross-taxon congruence is variable among sites and between\r\ndifferent groups (r values ranging between âˆ’0.53 to 0.88). In addition, our quantitative meta-\r\nanalysis demonstrated that organisms most similar in body size showed stronger species richness\r\ncorrelations than organisms which differed increasingly in size (radj2â€Š=â€Š0.94, pâ€Š=â€Š0.02). We propose\r\nthat future studies applying biodiversity indicators in aquatic ecosystems consider functional\r\ntraits such as body size, so as to increase their success at predicting the biodiversity of\r\ntaxonomic groups where cost-effective conservation tools are needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCryptic biodiversity in a changing world\r\n\r\nDNA studies are revealing the extent of hidden, or cryptic, biodiversity. Two new studies challenge\r\nparadigms about cryptic biodiversity and highlight the importance of adding a historical and\r\nbiogeographic dimension to biodiversity research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-Structuring of Marine Communities Exposed to Environmental Change: A Global Study on the Interactive Effects of Species and Functional Richness\r\n\r\nSpecies richness is the most commonly used but controversial biodiversity metric in studies on\r\naspects of community stability such as structural composition or productivity. The apparent\r\nambiguity of theoretical and experimental findings may in part be due to experimental shortcomings\r\nand/or heterogeneity of scales and methods in earlier studies. This has led to an urgent call for\r\nimproved and more realistic experiments. In a series of experiments replicated at a global scale we\r\ntranslocated several hundred marine hard bottom communities to new environments simulating a rapid\r\nbut moderate environmental change. Subsequently, we measured their rate of compositional change (re-\r\nstructuring) which in the great majority of cases represented a compositional convergence towards\r\nlocal communities. Re-structuring is driven by mortality of community components (original species)\r\nand establishment of new species in the changed environmental context. The rate of this re-\r\nstructuring was then related to various system properties. We show that availability of free\r\nsubstratum relates negatively while taxon richness relates positively to structural persistence\r\n(i.e., no or slow re-structuring). Thus, when faced with environmental change, taxon-rich\r\ncommunities retain their original composition longer than taxon-poor communities. The effect of\r\ntaxon richness, however, interacts with another aspect of diversity, functional richness. Indeed,\r\ntaxon richness relates positively to persistence in functionally depauperate communities, but not in\r\nfunctionally diverse communities. The interaction between taxonomic and functional diversity with\r\nregard to the behaviour of communities exposed to environmental stress may help understand some of\r\nthe seemingly contrasting findings of past research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiogeography of the ecosystems of the healthy human body\r\n\r\nBackground Characterizing the biogeography of the microbiome of healthy humans is essential for\r\nunderstanding microbial associated diseases. Previous studies mainly focused on a single body\r\nhabitat from a limited set of subjects. Here, we analyzed one of the largest microbiome datasets to\r\ndate and generated a biogeographical map that annotates the biodiversity, spatial relationships, and\r\ntemporal stability of 22 habitats from 279 healthy humans. Results We identified 929 genera from\r\nmore than 24 million 16S rRNA gene sequences of 22 habitats, and we provide a baseline of inter-\r\nsubject variation for healthy adults. The oral habitat has the most stable microbiota with the\r\nhighest alpha diversity, while the skin and vaginal microbiota are less stable and show lower alpha\r\ndiversity. The level of biodiversity in one habitat is independent of the biodiversity of other\r\nhabitats in the same individual. The abundances of a given genus at a body site in which it\r\ndominates do not correlate with the abundances at body sites where it is not dominant. Additionally,\r\nwe observed the human microbiota exhibit both cosmopolitan and endemic features. Finally, comparing\r\ndatasets of different projects revealed a project-based clustering pattern, emphasizing the\r\nsignificance of standardization of metagenomic studies. Conclusions The data presented here extend\r\nthe definition of the human microbiome by providing a more complete and accurate picture of human\r\nmicrobiome biogeography, addressing questions best answered by a large dataset of subjects and body\r\nsites that are deeply sampled by sequencing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","entities":{"Thing":[{"indices":[18,23],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[18,26],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[39,43],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[78,83],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[98,104],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[181,185],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[209,214],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[282,287],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[341,346],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[419,424],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[483,492]},{"indices":[515,519],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[573,576],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[579,585],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[601,624],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[610,618]},{"indices":[610,618]},{"indices":[610,618]},{"indices":[624,624],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[626,629]},{"indices":[695,704],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[828,833],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[865,876]},{"indices":[960,976],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[976,976],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1028,1037],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1109,1118],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1273,1285],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1276,1285],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1306,1318],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1309,1318],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1336,1341],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1346,1351],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1378,1387],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1388,1393],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1430,1442],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1433,1442],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1456,1461],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1466,1471],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1492,1497],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1560,1569],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1577,1582],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1587,1592],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1621,1630],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1686,1691],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1715,1724],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1753,1757],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1813,1821],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1824,1829],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1874,1879],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1880,1892],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[1883,1892],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2059,2064],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2165,2170],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2259,2264],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2291,2295],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2306,2314],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2347,2352],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2382,2386],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2411,2416],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2526,2534],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2557,2561],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2578,2594],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2578,2594],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2614,2622],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2655,2659],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2735,2747],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2738,2747],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2748,2757],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2770,2779],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2822,2826],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2878,2890],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2881,2890],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2895,2900],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2905,2910],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2979,2991],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[2982,2991],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3075,3087],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3078,3087],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3140,3152],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3143,3152],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3237,3249],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3240,3249],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3315,3335],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3394,3404],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3394,3413],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3417,3433],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3417,3433],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3478,3490],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3481,3490],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3534,3543],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[3563,3574],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4019,4039],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4072,4078],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4081,4092],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4172,4183],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4382,4388],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4531,4536],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4649,4669],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4671,4676],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4717,4728],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4741,4746],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4780,4785],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4838,4847]},{"indices":[4838,4847],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[4879,4884],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5039,5044],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5064,5073],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5260,5269],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5492,5499],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5653,5665],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5656,5665],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5704,5713],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5720,5727],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5844,5851],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[5938,5945],"safe.regex":"true"},{"indices":[6001,6010],"safe.regex":"true"},{

Genetics and Ethnobotany: A Crossed Investigation on the Elusive Tapir's Diet in French Guiana\r\n\r\nWhile the populations of large herbivores are being depleted in many tropical rainforests, the\r\nimportance of their trophic role in the ecological functioning and biodiversity of these ecosystems\r\nis still not well evaluated. This is due to the outstanding plant diversity that they feed upon and\r\nthe inherent difficulties involved in observing their elusive behaviour. Classically, the diet of\r\nelusive tropical herbivores is studied through the observation of browsing signs and macroscopic\r\nanalysis of faeces or stomach contents. In this study, we illustrate that the original coupling of\r\nclassic methods with genetic and ethnobotanical approaches yields information both about the diet\r\ndiversity, the foraging modalities and the potential impact on vegetation of the largest terrestrial\r\nmammal of Amazonia, the lowland tapir. The study was conducted in the Guianan shield, where the\r\necology of tapirs has been less investigated. We identified 92 new species, 51 new genera and 13 new\r\nfamilies of plants eaten by tapirs. We discuss the relative contribution of our different\r\napproaches, notably the contribution of genetic barcoding, used for the first time to investigate\r\nthe diet of a large tropical mammal, and how local traditional ecological knowledge is accredited\r\nand valuable for research on the ecology of elusive animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoving beyond abundance distributions: neutral theory and spatial patterns in a tropical forest\r\n\r\nAssessing the relative importance of different processes that determine the spatial distribution of\r\nspecies and the dynamics in highly diverse plant communities remains a challenging question in\r\necology. Previous modelling approaches often focused on single aggregated forest diversity patterns\r\nthat convey limited information on the underlying dynamic processes. Here, we use recent advances in\r\ninference for stochastic simulation models to evaluate the ability of a spatially explicit and\r\nspatially continuous neutral model to quantitatively predict six spatial and non-spatial patterns\r\nobserved at the 50 ha tropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The patterns capture\r\ndifferent aspects of forest dynamics and biodiversity structure, such as annual mortality rate,\r\nspecies richness, species abundance distribution, beta-diversity and the speciesâ€“area relationship\r\n(SAR). The model correctly predicted each pattern independently and up to five patterns\r\nsimultaneously. However, the model was unable to match the SAR and beta-diversity simultaneously.\r\nOur study moves previous theory towards a dynamic spatial theory of biodiversity and demonstrates\r\nthe value of spatial data to identify ecological processes. This opens up new avenues to evaluate\r\nthe consequences of additional process for community assembly and dynamics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsequences of tropical land use for multitrophic biodiversity and ecosystem functioning\r\n\r\nOur knowledge about land-use impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is mostly limited to\r\nsingle trophic levels, leaving us uncertain about whole-community biodiversity-ecosystem functioning\r\nrelationships. We analyse consequences of the globally important land-use transformation from\r\ntropical forests to oil palm plantations. Species diversity, density and biomass of invertebrate\r\ncommunities suffer at least 45% decreases from rainforest to oil palm. Combining metabolic and food-\r\nweb theory, we calculate annual energy fluxes to model impacts of land-use intensification on\r\nmultitrophic ecosystem functioning. We demonstrate a 51% reduction in energy fluxes from forest to\r\noil palm communities. Species loss clearly explains variation in energy fluxes; however, this\r\nrelationship depends on land-use systems and functional feeding guilds, whereby predators are the\r\nmost heavily affected. Biodiversity decline from forest to oil palm is thus accompanied by even\r\nstronger reductions in functionality, threatening to severely limit the functional resilience of\r\ncommunities to cope with future global changes.  Transformation of natural ecosystems into\r\nagricultural land is usually accompanied by extensive biodiversity loss. Calculating multitrophic\r\nenergy fluxes, Barnes et al. report severe reductions of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning from\r\ntropical rainforest to oil-palm plantations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo riparian reserves support dung beetle biodiversity and ecosystem services in oil palm-dominated tropical landscapes?\r\n\r\nAgricultural expansion and intensification are major threats to global biodiversity, ecological\r\nfunctions, and ecosystem services. The rapid expansion of oil palm in forested tropical landscapes\r\nis of particular concern given their high biodiversity. Identifying management approaches that\r\nmaintain native species and associated ecological processes within oil palm plantations is therefore\r\na priority. Riparian reserves are strips of forest retained alongside rivers in cultivated areas,\r\nprimarily for their positive hydrological impact. However, they can also support a range of forest-\r\ndependent species or ecosystem services. We surveyed communities of dung beetles and measured dung\r\nremoval activity in an oil palm-dominated landscape in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. The species\r\nrichness, diversity, and functional group richness of dung beetles in riparian reserves were\r\nsignificantly higher than in oil palm, but lower than in adjacent logged forests. The community\r\ncomposition of the riparian reserves was more similar to logged forest than oil palm. Despite the\r\npronounced differences in biodiversity, we did not find significant differences in dung removal\r\nrates among land uses. We also found no evidence that riparian reserves enhance dung removal rates\r\nwithin surrounding oil palm. These results contrast previous studies showing positive relationships\r\nbetween dung beetle species richness and dung removal in tropical forests. We found weak but\r\nsignificant positive relationships between riparian reserve width and dung beetle diversity, and\r\nbetween reserve vegetation complexity and dung beetle abundance, suggesting that these features may\r\nincrease the conservation value of riparian reserves. Synthesis and applications: The similarity\r\nbetween riparian reserves and logged forest demonstrates that retaining riparian reserves increases\r\nbiodiversity within oil palm landscapes. However, the lack of correlation between dung beetle\r\ncommunity characteristics and dung removal highlights the need for further research into spatial\r\nvariation in biodiversityâ€“ecosystem function relationships and how the results of such studies are\r\naffected by methodological choices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiodiversity Mapping in a Tropical West African Forest with Airborne Hyperspectral Data\r\n\r\nTropical forests are major repositories of biodiversity, but are fast disappearing as land is\r\nconverted to agriculture. Decision-makers need to know which of the remaining forests to prioritize\r\nfor conservation, but the only spatial information on forest biodiversity has, until recently, come\r\nfrom a sparse network of ground-based plots. Here we explore whether airborne hyperspectral imagery\r\ncan be used to predict the alpha diversity of upper canopy trees in a West African forest. The\r\nabundance of tree species were collected from 64 plots (each 1250 m2 in size) within a Sierra\r\nLeonean national park, and Shannon-Wiener biodiversity indices were calculated. An airborne\r\nspectrometer measured reflectances of 186 bands in the visible and near-infrared spectral range at 1\r\nm2 resolution. The standard deviations of these reflectance values and their first-order derivatives\r\nwere calculated for each plot from the c. 1250 pixels of hyperspectral information within them.\r\nShannon-Wiener indices were then predicted from these plot-based reflectance statistics using a\r\nmachine-learning algorithm (Random Forest). The regression model fitted the data well\r\n(pseudo-R2â€Š=â€Š84.9%), and we show that standard deviations of green-band reflectances and infra-red\r\nregion derivatives had the strongest explanatory powers. Our work shows that airborne hyperspectral\r\nsensing can be very effective at mapping canopy tree diversity, because its high spatial resolution\r\nallows within-plot heterogeneity in reflectance to

Gap Analysis to Prioritize Conservation Efforts in Eastern Africa\r\n\r\nCountries in eastern Africa have set aside significant proportions of their land for protection. But\r\nare these areas representative of the diverse range of species and habitats found in the region? And\r\ndo conservation efforts include areas where the state of biodiversity is likely to deteriorate\r\nwithout further interventions? Various studies have addressed these questions at global and\r\ncontinental scales. However, meaningful conservation decisions are required at finer geographical\r\nscales. To operate more effectively at the national level, finer scale baseline data on species and\r\non higher levels of biological organization such as the eco-regions are required, among other\r\nfactors. Here we adopted a recently developed high-resolution potential natural vegetation (PNV) map\r\nfor eastern Africa as a baseline to more effectively identify conservation priorities. We examined\r\nhow well different potential natural vegetations (PNVs) are represented in the protected area (PA)\r\nnetwork of eastern Africa and used a multivariate environmental similarity index to evaluate biases\r\nin PA versus PNV coverage. We additionally overlaid data of anthropogenic factors that potentially\r\ninfluence the natural vegetation to assess the level of threat to different PNVs. Our results\r\nindicate substantial differences in the conservation status of PNVs. In addition, particular PNVs in\r\nwhich biodiversity protection and ecological functions are at risk due to human influences are\r\nrevealed. The data and approach presented here provide a step forward in developing more transparent\r\nand better informed translation from global priorities to regional or national implementation in\r\neastern Africa, and are valid for other geographic regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the Fragmentation Threshold Hypothesis: Regime Shifts in Biodiversity Across Fragmented Landscapes\r\n\r\nEcological systems are vulnerable to irreversible change when key system properties are pushed over\r\nthresholds, resulting in the loss of resilience and the precipitation of a regime shift. Perhaps the\r\nmost important of such properties in human-modified landscapes is the total amount of remnant native\r\nvegetation. In a seminal study AndrÃ©n proposed the existence of a fragmentation threshold in the\r\ntotal amount of remnant vegetation, below which landscape-scale connectivity is eroded and local\r\nspecies richness and abundance become dependent on patch size. Despite the fact that species patch-\r\narea effects have been a mainstay of conservation science there has yet to be a robust empirical\r\nevaluation of this hypothesis. Here we present and test a new conceptual model describing the\r\nmechanisms and consequences of biodiversity change in fragmented landscapes, identifying the\r\nfragmentation threshold as a first step in a positive feedback mechanism that has the capacity to\r\nimpair ecological resilience, and drive a regime shift in biodiversity. The model considers that\r\nlocal extinction risk is defined by patch size, and immigration rates by landscape vegetation cover,\r\nand that the recovery from local species losses depends upon the landscape species pool. Using a\r\nunique dataset on the distribution of non-volant small mammals across replicate landscapes in the\r\nAtlantic forest of Brazil, we found strong evidence for our model predictions - that patch-area\r\neffects are evident only at intermediate levels of total forest cover, where landscape diversity is\r\nstill high and opportunities for enhancing biodiversity through local management are greatest.\r\nFurthermore, high levels of forest loss can push native biota through an extinction filter, and\r\nresult in the abrupt, landscape-wide loss of forest-specialist taxa, ecological resilience and\r\nmanagement effectiveness. The proposed model links hitherto distinct theoretical approaches within a\r\nsingle framework, providing a powerful tool for analysing the potential effectiveness of management\r\ninterventions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre We Filling the Data Void? An Assessment of the Amount and Extent of Plant Collection Records and Census Data Available for Tropical South America\r\n\r\nLarge-scale studies are needed to increase our understanding of how large-scale conservation\r\nthreats, such as climate change and deforestation, are impacting diverse tropical ecosystems. These\r\ntypes of studies rely fundamentally on access to extensive and representative datasets (i.e., â€œbig\r\ndataâ€�). In this study, I asses the availability of plant species occurrence records through the\r\nGlobal Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the distribution of networked vegetation census\r\nplots in tropical South America. I analyze how the amount of available data has changed through time\r\nand the consequent changes in taxonomic, spatial, habitat, and climatic representativeness. I show\r\nthat there are large and growing amounts of data available for tropical South America. Specifically,\r\nthere are almost 2,000,000 unique geo-referenced collection records representing more than 50,000\r\nspecies of plants in tropical South America and over 1,500 census plots. However, there is still a\r\ngaping â€œdata voidâ€� such that many species and many habitats remain so poorly represented in either\r\nof the databases as to be functionally invisible for most studies. It is important that we support\r\nefforts to increase the availability of data, and the representativeness of these data, so that we\r\ncan better predict and mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPredicting Tropical Dry Forest Successional Attributes from Space: Is the Key Hidden in Image Texture?\r\n\r\nBiodiversity conservation and ecosystem-service provision will increasingly depend on the existence\r\nof secondary vegetation. Our success in achieving these goals will be determined by our ability to\r\naccurately estimate the structure and diversity of such communities at broad geographic scales. We\r\nexamined whether the texture (the spatial variation of the image elements) of very high-resolution\r\nsatellite imagery can be used for this purpose. In 14 fallows of different ages and one mature\r\nforest stand in a seasonally dry tropical forest landscape, we estimated basal area, canopy cover,\r\nstem density, species richness, Shannon index, Simpson index, and canopy height. The first six\r\nattributes were also estimated for a subset comprising the tallest plants. We calculated 40 texture\r\nvariables based on the red and the near infrared bands, and EVI and NDVI, and selected the best-fit\r\nlinear models describing each vegetation attribute based on them. Basal area (R2â€Š=â€Š0.93), vegetation\r\nheight and cover (0.89), species richness (0.87), and stand age (0.85) were the best-described\r\nattributes by two-variable models. Cross validation showed that these models had a high predictive\r\npower, and most estimated vegetation attributes were highly accurate. The success of this simple\r\nmethod (a single image was used and the models were linear and included very few variables) rests on\r\nthe principle that image texture reflects the internal heterogeneity of successional vegetation at\r\nthe proper scale. The vegetation attributes best predicted by texture are relevant in the face of\r\ntwo of the gravest threats to biosphere integrity: climate change and biodiversity loss. By\r\nproviding reliable basal area and fallow-age estimates, image-texture analysis allows for the\r\nassessment of carbon sequestration and diversity loss rates. New and exciting research avenues open\r\nby simplifying the analysis of the extent and complexity of successional vegetation through the\r\nspatial variation of its spectral information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssessments of Drought Impacts on Vegetation in China with the Optimal Time Scales of the Climatic Drought Index\r\n\r\nDrought is expected to increase in frequency and severity due to global warming, and its impacts on\r\nvegetation are typically extensively evaluated with climatic drought indices, such as multi-scalar\r\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). We analyzed the covariation between the\r\nSPEIs of various time scales and the anomalies of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI),\r\nfrom which the vegetation type-related optimal time scales were retrieved. The results indicated\r\nthat the optimal time scales of needle-leaved forest, broadleaf forest and shrubland were between 10\r\nand 12 months, which were considerably longer than the grassland, meadow and cultivated vegetation\r\nones (2 to 4 months). When the optimal vegetation type-related time scales were used, the SPEI could\r\nbetter reflect the vegetationâ€™s responses to water conditions, with the correlation coefficients\r\nbetween SPEIs and NDVI anomalies increased by 5.88% to 28.4%. We investigated the spatio-temporal\r\ncharacteristics of drought and quantified the different responses of vegetation growth to drought\r\nduring the growing season (Aprilâ€“October). The results revealed that the frequency of drought has\r\nincreased in the 21st century with the drying trend occurring in most of China.

Water and Fish: Biodiversity Impacts of Energy-Sector Water Demand in the United States Depend on Efficiency and Policy Measures\r\n\r\nRising energy consumption in coming decades, combined with a changing energy mix, have the potential\r\nto increase the impact of energy sector water use on freshwater biodiversity. We forecast changes in\r\nfuture water use based on various energy scenarios and examine implications for freshwater\r\necosystems. Annual water withdrawn/manipulated would increase by 18â€“24%, going from\r\n1,993,000â€“2,628,000 Mm3 in 2010 to 2,359,000â€“3,271,000 Mm3 in 2035 under the Reference Case of the\r\nEnergy Information Administration (EIA). Water consumption would more rapidly increase by 26% due to\r\nincreased biofuel production, going from 16,700â€“46,400 Mm3 consumption in 2010 to 21,000â€“58,400 Mm3\r\nconsumption in 2035. Regionally, water use in the Southwest and Southeast may increase, with\r\nanticipated decreases in water use in some areas of the Midwest and Northeast. Policies that promote\r\nenergy efficiency or conservation in the electric sector would reduce water withdrawn/manipulated by\r\n27â€“36 m3GJâˆ’1 (0.1â€“0.5 m3GJâˆ’1 consumption), while such policies in the liquid fuel sector would\r\nreduce withdrawal/manipulation by 0.4â€“0.7 m3GJâˆ’1 (0.2â€“0.3 m3GJâˆ’1 consumption). The greatest energy\r\nsector withdrawal/manipulation are for hydropower and thermoelectric cooling, although potential new\r\nEPA rules that would require recirculating cooling for thermoelectric plants would reduce\r\nwithdrawal/manipulation by 441,000 Mm3 (20,300 Mm3 consumption). The greatest consumptive energy\r\nsector use is evaporation from hydroelectric reservoirs, followed by irrigation water for biofuel\r\nfeedstocks and water used for electricity generation from coal. Historical water use by the energy\r\nsector is related to patterns of fish species endangerment, where water resource regions with a\r\ngreater fraction of available surface water withdrawn by hydropower or consumed by the energy sector\r\ncorrelated with higher probabilities of imperilment. Since future increases in energy-sector surface\r\nwater use will occur in areas of high fish endemism (e.g., Southeast), additional management and\r\npolicy actions will be needed to minimize further species imperilment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarine Biodiversity in Japanese Waters\r\n\r\nTo understand marine biodiversity in Japanese waters, we have compiled information on the marine\r\nbiota in Japanese waters, including the number of described species (species richness), the history\r\nof marine biology research in Japan, the state of knowledge, the number of endemic species, the\r\nnumber of identified but undescribed species, the number of known introduced species, and the number\r\nof taxonomic experts and identification guides, with consideration of the general ocean\r\nenvironmental background, such as the physical and geological settings. A total of 33,629 species\r\nhave been reported to occur in Japanese waters. The state of knowledge was extremely variable, with\r\ntaxa containing many inconspicuous, smaller species tending to be less well known. The total number\r\nof identified but undescribed species was at least 121,913. The total number of described species\r\ncombined with the number of identified but undescribed species reached 155,542. This is the best\r\nestimate of the total number of species in Japanese waters and indicates that more than 70% of\r\nJapan's marine biodiversity remains un-described. The number of species reported as introduced into\r\nJapanese waters was 39. This is the first attempt to estimate species richness for all marine\r\nspecies in Japanese waters. Although its marine biota can be considered relatively well known, at\r\nleast within the Asian-Pacific region, considering the vast number of different marine environments\r\nsuch as coral reefs, ocean trenches, ice-bound waters, methane seeps, and hydrothermal vents, much\r\nwork remains to be done. We expect global change to have a tremendous impact on marine biodiversity\r\nand ecosystems. Japan is in a particularly suitable geographic situation and has a lot of facilities\r\nfor conducting marine science research. Japan has an important responsibility to contribute to our\r\nunderstanding of life in the oceans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Overview of Marine Biodiversity in United States Waters\r\n\r\nMarine biodiversity of the United States (U.S.) is extensively documented, but data assembled by the\r\nUnited States National Committee for the Census of Marine Life demonstrate that even the most\r\ncomplete taxonomic inventories are based on records scattered in space and time. The best-known taxa\r\nare those of commercial importance. Body size is directly correlated with knowledge of a species,\r\nand knowledge also diminishes with distance from shore and depth. Measures of biodiversity other\r\nthan species diversity, such as ecosystem and genetic diversity, are poorly documented. Threats to\r\nmarine biodiversity in the U.S. are the same as those for most of the world: overexploitation of\r\nliving resources; reduced water quality; coastal development; shipping; invasive species; rising\r\ntemperature and concentrations of carbon dioxide in the surface ocean, and other changes that may be\r\nconsequences of global change, including shifting currents; increased number and size of hypoxic or\r\nanoxic areas; and increased number and duration of harmful algal blooms. More information must be\r\nobtained through field and laboratory research and monitoring that involve innovative sampling\r\ntechniques (such as genetics and acoustics), but data that already exist must be made accessible.\r\nAnd all data must have a temporal component so trends can be identified. As data are compiled,\r\ntechniques must be developed to make certain that scales are compatible, to combine and reconcile\r\ndata collected for various purposes with disparate gear, and to automate taxonomic changes.\r\nInformation on biotic and abiotic elements of the environment must be interactively linked.\r\nImpediments to assembling existing data and collecting new data on marine biodiversity include\r\nlogistical problems as well as shortages in finances and taxonomic expertise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Status and Future Prospects for the Assessment of Marine and Coastal Ecosystem Services: A Systematic Review\r\n\r\nBackground Research on ecosystem services has grown exponentially during the last decade. Most of\r\nthe studies have focused on assessing and mapping terrestrial ecosystem services highlighting a\r\nknowledge gap on marine and coastal ecosystem services (MCES) and an urgent need to assess them.\r\nMethodology/Principal Findings We reviewed and summarized existing scientific literature related to\r\nMCES with the aim of extracting and classifying indicators used to assess and map them. We found 145\r\npapers that specifically assessed marine and coastal ecosystem services from which we extracted 476\r\nindicators. Food provision, in particular fisheries, was the most extensively analyzed MCES while\r\nwater purification and coastal protection were the most frequently studied regulating and\r\nmaintenance services. Also recreation and tourism under the cultural services was relatively well\r\nassessed. We highlight knowledge gaps regarding the availability of indicators that measure the\r\ncapacity, flow or benefit derived from each ecosystem service. The majority of the case studies was\r\nfound in mangroves and coastal wetlands and was mainly concentrated in Europe and North America. Our\r\nsystematic review highlighted the need of an improved ecosystem service classification for marine\r\nand coastal systems, which is herein proposed with definitions and links to previous\r\nclassifications. Conclusions/Significance This review summarizes the state of available information\r\nrelated to ecosystem services associated with marine and coastal ecosystems. The cataloging of MCES\r\nindicators and the integrated classification of MCES provided in this paper establish a background\r\nthat can facilitate the planning and integration of future assessments. The final goal is to\r\nestablish a consistent structure and populate it with information able to support the implementation\r\nof biodiversity conservation policies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrobiome of free-living amoebae isolated from drinking water.\r\n\r\nFree-living amoebae (FLA) are protozoa that can be found in water networks where they prey on\r\nbacteria within biofilms. Most bacteria are digested rapidly by phagocytosis, however some are able\r\nto survive within amoebae and some are even able to multiply, as it is the case for Legionella\r\npneumophila. These resisting bacteria are a potential health problem as they could also resist to\r\nmacrophage phagocytosis. Several publications already reported intra-amoebal bacteria but the\r\nmethods of identification did not allow metagenomic analysis and are partly based on co-culture with\r\none selected amoebal strain. The aim of our study was to conduct a rRNA-targeted metagenomic\r\nanalysis on amoebae and intra-amoebal bacteria found in drinking water network, to provide the first\r\nFLA microbiome in environmental strains. Three sites of a water network were sampled during four\r\nmonths. Culturable FLA were isolated and total DNA was prepared, allowing purification of both\r\namoebal and bacterial DNA. Metagenomic studies were then conducted through 18S or 16S amplicons\r\nsequencing. Hartmannella was by far the most represented genus of FLA. Regarding intra-amoebal\r\nbacteria, 54 genera were identified, among which 21 were newly described intra-amoebal bacteria,\r\nunderlying the power of our approach. There were high differences in bacterial diversity between the\r\nthree sites.
